    Solves the Cutting Stock Problem to minimize the total number of raw rolls cut.

    Args:
        roll_width: An integer, the width of the raw rolls.
        widths: A list of integers, the set of widths to be cut.
        orders: A list of integers, the number of orders for each width.
        num_patterns: An integer, the number of different patterns.
        num_rolls_width: A list of lists, where each inner list contains the number of rolls of a particular width in a given pattern.
