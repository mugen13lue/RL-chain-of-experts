Consider a problem where we have a set `P`. For each element `j` in `P`, we have a parameter `a[j]`, a parameter `c[j]`, and a parameter `u[j]`. We also have a global parameter `b`. We have a variable `X[j]` for each `j` in `P`. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of `c[j] * X[j]` for all `j` in `P`. The constraints are that the sum of `(1/a[j]) * X[j]` for all `j` in `P` should be less than or equal to `b`, and `X[j]` should be between 0 and `u[j]` for all `j` in `P`.
