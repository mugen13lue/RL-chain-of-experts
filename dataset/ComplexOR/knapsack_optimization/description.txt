The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in operations research and computer science. The problem is to determine the most valuable combination of items to include in a knapsack, given a set of items with different values and weights, and a maximum weight capacity of the knapsack. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.
