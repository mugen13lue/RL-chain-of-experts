  "description": "Consider a network flow problem. Given a set of cities `Cities` and a set of links `Links` between the cities. Each city `i` has a certain supply of goods `Supply_{i}` and a certain demand for goods `Demand_{i}`. The cost of shipping one ton of goods over link `(i, j)` is `Cost_{i, j}`. Each city `i` has a maximum throughput `CityCapacity_{i}` and each link `(i, j)` has a maximum shipment `LinkCapacity_{i, j}`. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of shipping goods over the network. The shipment over each link `(i, j)` should not exceed its capacity and the flow through each city `i` should not exceed its capacity. How to decide the amount of goods to be shipped over each link `(i, j)` and through each city `i`?",
