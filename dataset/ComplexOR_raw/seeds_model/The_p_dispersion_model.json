  "title": "The p-dispersion Model for Facility Dispersion Problem",
  "description": "In some facility location problems, facilities need to be positioned so that the influence of one doesnâ€™t overshadow or adversely affect the others. Suppose the distances (or some other dispersion metric) between two locations are computed in advance. The p-dispersion problem must define the location of p facilities among a set of discrete nodes to maximize the minimum distance between all pairs of selected nodes.",
