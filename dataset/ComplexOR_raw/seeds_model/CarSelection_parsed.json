  "description": "The Car Selection Problem is a mixed integer programming model that aims to assign participants to cars in a way that maximizes the total number of assignments. The problem involves a set of participants and a set of cars, where each participant is interested in a subset of cars. The objective is to find the optimal assignment of participants to cars that satisfies certain constraints.",
