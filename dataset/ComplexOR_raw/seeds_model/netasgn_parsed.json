  "description": "Consider a project assignment problem. Given a set of people `People` and a set of projects `Projects`. Each person `i` has a certain number of available hours `Supply_{i}` and each project `j` requires a certain number of hours `Demand_{j}`. The cost per hour of work for person `i` on project `j` is `Cost_{i, j}`. Each person `i` can contribute to project `j` up to a maximum limit `Limit_{i, j}`. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of assigning people to projects. It is constrained that the total number of hours assigned from each person `i` equals its supply and the total number of hours assigned to each project `j` equals its demand. How to decide the number of hours to be assigned from each person `i` to each project `j`?",
