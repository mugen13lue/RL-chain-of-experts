  "description": "This is a network flow problem. Given a set of cities `Cities` and a set of links `Links` between the cities. Each city `i` has a certain supply of goods `Supply_{i}` and a certain demand for goods `Demand_{i}`. The cost of shipping one package from city `i` to city `j` is `ShippingCost_{i, j}` and the maximum number of packages that can be shipped from city `i` to city `j` is `Capacity_{i, j}`. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of shipping packages from the cities to the cities. How to decide the number of packages to be shipped from each city `i` to each city `j`?",
