  "title": "The Maxisum Model for Facility Dispersion Problem",
  "description": "In some facility location problems, facilities need to be positioned so that the influence of one doesnâ€™t overshadow or adversely affect the others. Suppose the distances (or some other dispersion metric) between two locations are computed in advance. The discrete maxisum problem must define the location of p facilities among a set of discrete nodes to maximize the sum of distances (or the average of distances) computed between all pairs of selected facilities.",
