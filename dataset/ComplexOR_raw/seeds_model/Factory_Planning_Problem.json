  "title": "Factory Planning Problem",
  "description": "A factory makes several products using a range of machines such as, Four grinders, Two vertical drills and One borer. Each product has a defined profit contribution per unit sold (defined as the sales price per unit minus the cost of raw materials). In addition, the manufacturing of each product requires a certain amount of time on each machine (in hours). Machines are scheduled to be down for maintenance. We can store a limited number of products in the inventory for a certain cost per unit and month. There are limitations on how many of each product can be sold in a given month. We want to find the optimal production and inventory plan that maximize the profit.",
