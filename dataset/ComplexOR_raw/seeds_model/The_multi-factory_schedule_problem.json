  "title": "Multi-Factory Schedule Problem",
  "description": "The Multi-Factory Schedule Problem assumes we are optimizing the production of a good from a set of factories over the course of a set of months. If a factory runs during a month, a fixed cost is incurred, the factory must produce an amount of units that is within some minimum and maximum production levels, respectively, and each unit of production incurs a variable cost. Otherwise, the factory can be shut for the month with zero production and no fixed-cost is incurred. The factory must produce enough units to satisfy demand of each month.",
