  "description": "Consider a transportation problem. Given a set of origins `Origins` and a set of destinations `Destinations`. Each origin `i` has a certain supply of goods `Supply_{i}` and each destination `j` has a certain demand for goods `Demand_{j}`. The cost of shipping one unit of goods from origin `i` to destination `j` is `Rate_{i, j}`. However, the number of units shipped can't exceed the limit `Limit_{i, j}`. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of shipping goods from the origins to the destinations. How to decide the number of units to be shipped from each origin `i` to each destination `j`?",
