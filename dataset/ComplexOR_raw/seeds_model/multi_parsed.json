  "description": "This is a multi-commodity transportation problem. Given a set of origins `Origins`, a set of destinations `Destinations`, and a set of products `Products`. Each origin `i` has a certain supply of each product `p` `Supply_{i,p}` and each destination `j` has a certain demand for each product `p` `Demand_{j,p}`. The cost of shipping one unit of product `p` from origin `i` to destination `j` is `ShippingCost_{i, j, p}`. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of shipping all products from the origins to the destinations. It is constrained that the total amount of each product `p` shipped from each origin `i` equals its supply, the total amount of each product `p` shipped to each destination `j` equals its demand, and the total amount of all products shipped from each origin `i` to each destination `j` does not exceed a certain limit `Limit_{i,j}`. How to decide the number of units of each product `p` to be shipped from each origin `i` to each destination `j`?",
