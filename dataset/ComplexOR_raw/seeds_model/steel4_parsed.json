  "description": "Consider a production problem. Given a set of products `Products` and a set of stages `Stages`. Each product `p` has a certain production rate `Rate_{p, s}` in each stage `s` and a certain profit `Profit_{p}` per ton. Each stage `s` has a certain number of hours `Available_{s}` available per week. There are also lower and upper limits on the tons of each product sold in a week, `Commit_{p}` and `Market_{p}` respectively. The problem aims to maximize the total profit from all products. It is constrained that the total number of hours used by all products in each stage `s` may not exceed the hours available. How to decide the number of tons to be produced for each product `p`?",
