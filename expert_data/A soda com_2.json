{"comment": "Optimization problem:An optimization problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions. In this case, we are trying to maximize the total number of units produced while meeting certain constraints.\nConstraint:Constraints are conditions that must be satisfied in an optimization problem. In this case, the constraints include bottling at least 1000000 ml of soda, having at least three times more cans than glass bottles, and producing at least 100 glass bottles.\nLinear programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. It can be used to solve optimization problems like the one presented here.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
