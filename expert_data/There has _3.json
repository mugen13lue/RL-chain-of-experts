{"comment": "Optimization:The process of finding the best solution among a set of feasible options to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to solve a problem or reach a desired outcome. In this case, constraints include the maximum number of bus trips and the requirement for at least 30% of trips to be by helicopter.\nInteger Programming:A mathematical optimization technique where the variables in the problem are restricted to be integers, which is suitable for problems involving discrete decisions like choosing the number of helicopter and bus trips in this scenario.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
