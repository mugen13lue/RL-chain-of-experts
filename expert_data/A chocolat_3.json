{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using linear programming:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_149(vans, trucks):\n    c = [1, 1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize Z = x + y\n    A = [[-50, -80], [-30, -50], [-1, 1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [-1500, -1000, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, None), (0, None)])\n\n    return res.fun\n\n# Test the function with initial values\nprint(prob_149(0, 0))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to minimize `Z = x + y`, where `x` is the number of trips by vans and `y` is the number of trips by trucks. The inequality constraints are based on the given problem constraints. The function returns the minimum value of the objective function, which represents the total number of trips needed to transport the chocolate boxes.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
