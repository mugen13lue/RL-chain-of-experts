{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: It is recommended to use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability. For example, instead of 'x' and 'y', consider using 'num_basketballs' and 'num_footballs'.\n\n2. Function Documentation: While the function 'prob_267' has a docstring, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed information about the input parameters and the expected output.\n\n3. Error Handling: It would be helpful to include error handling mechanisms in the code to handle potential exceptions that may arise during the optimization process.\n\n4. Code Structure: Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions to improve modularity and maintainability.\n\n5. Testing: It is essential to thoroughly test the function with different input values to ensure its correctness and reliability.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the code can be enhanced in terms of readability, robustness, and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
