{"comment": "Linear Programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints.\nConstraints:Constraints are restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in a linear programming problem. In this case, the constraints include the minimum daily calorie and protein requirements.\nObjective Function:The objective function in a linear programming problem is the equation that needs to be optimized (minimized or maximized). In this case, the objective function would be to minimize the cost of the diet.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
