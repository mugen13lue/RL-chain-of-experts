{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, I have identified a potential issue in the objective function definition. The objective function is set to minimize the total waste produced by machine 1 and machine 2, which is correct. However, the objective function should be to minimize the total amount of waste produced, not just the waste produced by the machines individually.\n\nTo address this issue, the objective function should be updated to reflect the total amount of waste produced by both machines combined. Here is the corrected objective function definition:\n\n```python\n# Set objective function: minimize total amount of waste produced\nmodel.setObjective(Waste_Machine1 + Waste_Machine2, sense=GRB.MINIMIZE)\n```\n\nWith this correction, the code will now correctly minimize the total amount of waste produced by both machines, as intended.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
