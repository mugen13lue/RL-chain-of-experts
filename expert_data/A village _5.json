{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python code that solves the transportation optimization problem using linear programming. Here are some key points based on the comments and code:\n\n1. The code correctly defines the objective function to minimize the number of bikes needed (`y`) and sets up the inequality constraints based on the information provided by the experts.\n2. The `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module is used to solve the linear programming problem, which is a suitable choice for this optimization problem.\n3. The code structure is clear and well-organized, making it easy to understand the problem formulation and solution approach.\n4. The function `prob_178()` encapsulates the problem-solving logic, making it reusable and modular.\n5. The code correctly calculates and returns the minimum number of bikes needed to transport at least 500 people while minimizing the total number of bikes used.\n\nOverall, the code implementation aligns well with the problem requirements and expert recommendations. It effectively solves the transportation optimization problem and provides the desired output. Great job on implementing the solution using linear programming techniques!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
