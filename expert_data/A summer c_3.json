{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming model for the given problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_102(beaker_1, beaker_2, constraint1, constraint2, constraint3, constraint4, constraint5, constraint6):\n    c = [-5, -3]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize (-5x - 3y to maximize 5x + 3y)\n    A = [[4, 6], [6, 3], [4, 2]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [constraint1, constraint2, constraint3]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for x and y (non-negativity constraints)\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n    if res.success:\n        amount_of_slime = -res.fun  # Maximum amount of slime produced\n        return amount_of_slime\n    else:\n        return \"No feasible solution found.\"\n\n# Example usage\nprint(prob_102(4, 6, 150, 100, 30, 4, 2, 5))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to maximize the amount of slime produced (5x + 3y), subject to the given constraints on flour, special liquid, waste, and non-negativity. The function returns the maximum amount of slime that can be produced given the constraints.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
