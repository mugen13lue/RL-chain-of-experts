{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, the LP formulation for the medicine optimization problem is as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of pills of Zodiac\n- Let y be the number of pills of Sunny\n\nConstraints:\n1. Z1 requirement: 1.3x + 1.2y \u2265 5\n2. D3 requirement: 1.5x + 5y \u2265 10\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\nMinimize Cost: x + 3y\n\nThe Python code provided by the Programming Expert is a correct implementation of the LP model using the Gurobi optimization library. The function `prob_26` takes the number of pills of Zodiac and Sunny as input and returns the optimal objective value, which is the minimum cost to fulfill the medicine requirements.\n\nYou can use this code to solve the medicine optimization problem efficiently. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
