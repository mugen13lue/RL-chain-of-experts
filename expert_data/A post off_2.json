{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, in this case, minimizing the total number of stamping machines while meeting the given constraints.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this case, the constraints are related to the minimum number of letters stamped per minute and the maximum units of glue used per minute.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to find the optimal number of each stamping machine to purchase.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
