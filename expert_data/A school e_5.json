{"comment": "Upon reviewing the code provided for the teacher hiring optimization problem, I have identified a few areas for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: In the `prob_50` function, the variables `staff_teachers` and `substitute_teachers` are passed as arguments but not used within the function. It would be clearer to rename these variables to `requires_constraint` and `budget_constraint` to match their actual purpose.\n\n2. Function Documentation: The function `prob_50` lacks detailed documentation explaining the purpose of the function, the inputs required, and the output returned. It would be beneficial to provide a more descriptive docstring to enhance readability and understanding.\n\n3. Code Consistency: The code snippet provided by the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert are identical. It seems like there was a duplication of the same code. It would be better to remove one of the duplicate code snippets to avoid confusion.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation of the optimization problem are correct, following the defined variables, constraints, and objective function. By addressing the mentioned areas for improvement, the code can be enhanced for better readability and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
