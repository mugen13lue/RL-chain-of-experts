{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, the linear programming problem for Bob's diet can be formulated as follows:\n\nLet x be the number of servings of noodles and y be the number of servings of protein bars.\n\nObjective:\nMinimize Z = 5x + 2.5y (Total cost of the diet)\n\nConstraints:\n5x + 2.5y >= Total cost of the diet\n600x + 250y >= 2000 (Total daily calorie requirement)\n1.5x + 5y >= 16 (Total daily protein requirement)\nx, y >= 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, you can use the provided Python code snippet that utilizes the linprog function from the scipy.optimize module. The function prob_205 takes the number of servings of protein bars and noodles as input and returns the minimum cost of the diet. You can call this function with specific values to find the optimal solution for Bob's diet.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
