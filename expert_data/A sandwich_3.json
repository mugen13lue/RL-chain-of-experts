{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using linear programming:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_52(dine_in_place, food_truck):\n    c = [1, 1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize Z = x + y\n    A = [[-100, -50], [8, 3]]  # Coefficients of the production and employee constraints\n    b = [-500, 35]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for x and y\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n    return res.fun\n\n# Testing the function with initial values\nprint(prob_52(0, 0))  # Output should be 0\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to minimize `Z = x + y` subject to the given constraints. The function returns the optimal objective value, which represents the total number of stores to be opened.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
