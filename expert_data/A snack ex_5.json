{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python code that solves the snack exporter problem using linear programming. Here are my findings:\n\n1. The code correctly defines the objective function to maximize the total number of snacks that can be delivered based on the number of small and large suitcases.\n2. The constraints are accurately implemented in the form of inequality constraints to ensure that the solution adheres to the given limitations.\n3. The `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module is appropriately utilized to solve the linear programming problem and find the optimal values for small and large suitcases.\n4. The conversion of the negative optimal value to a positive value is correctly handled to reflect the maximization objective.\n\nOverall, the code is well-structured, follows best practices for linear programming optimization, and provides the expected output of 3650 when tested with the given constraints. There are no errors, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement identified in the code. It effectively addresses the snack exporter problem and delivers optimal results.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
