{"comment": "After reviewing the provided code and problem statement, I have identified a potential issue in the code that needs to be addressed. The problem statement requires that the body wash must contain at least 300 units of coconut oil and at most 550 units of both ingredients combined. Additionally, the ratio of coconut oil to lavender should be at most 3:1.\n\nHowever, the current implementation of the code does not explicitly handle the constraint related to the maximum total amount of both ingredients (550 units). To address this issue, we need to modify the \"Total Ingredient Limit\" constraint to ensure that the sum of coconut oil and lavender does not exceed 550 units.\n\nHere is the updated constraint in the code:\n\n```python\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 300, name=\"coconut_oil_requirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(x + y <= 550, name=\"total_ingredient_limit\")  # Updated constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 3*y, name=\"coconut_oil_to_lavender_ratio\")\n```\n\nBy adding this updated constraint, the code will now properly handle the restriction on the total amount of both ingredients in the body wash. This modification ensures that the optimization problem is solved correctly according to the requirements specified in the problem statement.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
