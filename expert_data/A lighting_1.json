{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of LED fixtures\n- y: number of fluorescence lamps\n\nDefinitions:\n- x: number of LED fixtures to be installed\n- y: number of fluorescence lamps to be installed\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n1. Electricity Constraint: 5x + 8y \u2264 2000\n   - The total units of electricity used by LED fixtures and fluorescence lamps should not exceed 2000 units.\n\n2. Minimum Fluorescence Constraint: y \u2265 0.3(x + y)\n   - At least 30% of the implemented lights must be fluorescence lamps.\n\n3. Minimum Light Fixtures Constraint: x + y \u2265 300\n   - The total number of light fixtures installed should be at least 300.\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- Minimize the total number of light changes: 3x + 4y\n   - The objective is to minimize the total number of times lights need to be changed by considering the number of LED fixtures and fluorescence lamps installed.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
