The objective function is to maximize the profit, and the constraints are the budget constraint, the number of cucumbers constraint, and the number of carrots sold constraint. The decision variables are the number of carrots and cucumbers sold. The code returns the maximum profit that can be achieved given the constraints.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
