The objective is to maximize the total number of bottles produced (x + y) subject to the given constraints. The decision variables x and y represent the number of kids size bottles and adult size bottles to be made, respectively. The constraints ensure that at least 50 kids size bottles are made, the total amount of cough syrup available is not exceeded, and the ratio of adult size bottles to kids size bottles is at least 3.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
