The coefficients of the objective function, inequality constraints, and right-hand side values are set according to the problem constraints. The function returns the minimum total time achieved by optimizing the amounts of sulfate and ginger added to the shampoo.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
