{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the Linear Programming (LP) model for the inventory optimization problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- \\( x \\): number of phones to keep in inventory\n- \\( y \\): number of laptops to keep in inventory\n\nParameters:\n- \\( P_{phone} = $120 \\): profit earned from selling one phone\n- \\( P_{laptop} = $40 \\): profit earned from selling one laptop\n- \\( S_{phone} = 1 \\): square feet of floor space required for one phone\n- \\( S_{laptop} = 4 \\): square feet of floor space required for one laptop\n- \\( F_{total} = 400 \\): total square feet of floor space available\n- \\( C_{phone} = $400 \\): cost of one phone for the store\n- \\( C_{laptop} = $100 \\): cost of one laptop for the store\n- \\( B = $6000 \\): maximum budget for the store\n- \\( R = 0.8 \\): minimum percentage of laptops in stock required by corporate\n\nObjective:\nMaximize profit: \\( Z = P_{phone}x + P_{laptop}y \\)\n\nConstraints:\n1. Floor space constraint: \\( S_{phone}x + S_{laptop}y \\leq F_{total} \\)\n2. Budget constraint: \\( C_{phone}x + C_{laptop}y \\leq B \\)\n3. Corporate requirement constraint: \\( y \\geq R(x+y) \\)\n\nThe provided Python code implements the LP model using the Gurobi optimization library. The `prob_28` function takes the number of phones and laptops as input, creates the LP model, defines decision variables, sets the objective function to maximize profit, adds constraints for floor space, budget, and corporate requirements, optimizes the model, and returns the maximum profit.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation align with the formulated LP model and constraints. It effectively solves the inventory optimization problem to maximize profit while considering the specified constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
