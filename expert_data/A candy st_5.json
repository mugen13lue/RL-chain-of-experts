{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, it seems that the problem can be effectively solved using linear programming techniques. The objective function is to maximize the total profit, which is represented by \\( Z = 3x + 5y \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of kilograms of regular mix and \\( y \\) is the number of kilograms of sour surprise mix.\n\nThe constraints include the limits on the available regular candy and sour candy, which are represented as:\n- \\( 0.8x + 0.1y \\leq 80 \\) for regular candy\n- \\( 0.2x + 0.9y \\leq 60 \\) for sour candy\n- \\( x \\geq 0 \\) and \\( y \\geq 0 \\) for non-negativity\n\nThe Python code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert effectively implements the linear programming problem using the PuLP library. It defines decision variables, sets the objective function, adds constraints, and solves the problem to find the maximum profit achievable by producing the regular mix and sour surprise mix candies.\n\nYou can test the function `prob_29` with the given constraints on the available regular and sour candy to determine the maximum profit that can be achieved. The function returns the maximum profit value, which can help in making decisions on how many kilograms of each type of candy mix should be created to maximize profits.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
