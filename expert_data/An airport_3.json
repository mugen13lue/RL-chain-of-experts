{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, typically to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution to the problem. In this case, the constraints are related to the number of luggage that need to be moved and the pollutant levels that need to be kept under a certain threshold.\nObjective Function:A function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is to minimize the total number of vehicles needed to move the luggage while meeting the constraints.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
