{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables x and y represent the number of canoes and diesel boats used, respectively. The constraints are correctly defined as:\n   - Transportation Constraint: 10x + 15y >= 1000\n   - Environmental Constraint: x >= 3y\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective function is to minimize the total number of canoes and diesel boats needed, which is represented as Z = x + y.\n\n3. **Code Structure**: The code structure is well-organized and follows best practices for defining variables, constraints, and the objective function using the Gurobi library.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The model is optimized using the Gurobi optimizer to find the optimal solution for the total number of canoes and diesel boats needed.\n\n5. **Function Documentation**: The function `prob_197` is well-documented with clear input parameters and return value.\n\n6. **Reusability**: The function can be easily reused for different scenarios by providing the number of small canoes and smaller diesel boats as input parameters.\n\nOverall, the code implementation aligns with the problem requirements and the modeling approach suggested by your colleagues. It effectively solves the optimization problem of minimizing the total number of canoes and diesel boats needed to transport at least 1000 fish back to shore while adhering to environmental rules.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
