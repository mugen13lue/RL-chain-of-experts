{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python code for solving the linear programming problem to minimize the wage bill. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The code structure is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the objective function, constraints, and the optimization process using the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize`.\n\n2. The variable names `c`, `A`, and `b` are appropriately chosen to represent the coefficients of the objective function, constraints, and the right-hand side of the constraints, respectively.\n\n3. The constraints are correctly defined based on the problem statement, ensuring that the solution satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n4. The `linprog` function is used effectively to find the optimal solution that minimizes the wage bill while meeting all the constraints.\n\n5. The function `prob_15` takes the number of senior citizens and young adults as input parameters, allowing for flexibility in testing different scenarios.\n\n6. The code includes a test case to verify the function's correctness by providing sample input values and checking the output.\n\nOverall, the code is well-written and effectively solves the linear programming problem to minimize the wage bill. I recommend adding more comments to explain the purpose of each constraint and variable for better readability and maintainability. Additionally, consider handling potential edge cases, such as when the constraints are infeasible, to provide informative feedback to the user. Great job on implementing the solution!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
