{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- \\( x \\): number of trains\n- \\( y \\): number of trams\n\nDefinitions:\n- \\( x \\): represents the number of trains to be used for transportation\n- \\( y \\): represents the number of trams to be used for transportation\n\nConstraints:\n- \\( x \\geq 0 \\): non-negativity constraint for the number of trains\n- \\( y \\geq 0 \\): non-negativity constraint for the number of trams\n- \\( y \\geq 2x \\): the number of trams must be at least twice the number of trains\n- \\( 120x + 30y \\geq 600 \\): the total number of people transported per hour must be at least 600\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize \\( Z = x + y \\): minimize the total number of transportation units required, which is the sum of trains and trams.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
