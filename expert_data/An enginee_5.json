{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: Ensure that the variables `beam_bridges` and `truss_bridges` in the `prob_147` function are appropriately named to reflect their purpose in the context of the problem. Consider using `x` and `y` as suggested in the Parameter Extractor section for consistency.\n\n2. **Objective Function Coefficients**: The objective function coefficients `-40` and `-60` in the `c` list should be correctly aligned with the objective function to maximize `40x + 60y`.\n\n3. **Inequality Constraints**: Verify that the coefficients in the `A` matrix and the right-hand side values in the `b` list accurately represent the constraints derived from the problem statement and the Parameter Extractor section.\n\n4. **Bounds**: Ensure that the bounds `(0, None)` specified in the `linprog` function are appropriate for the variables `x` and `y` in the context of the problem.\n\n5. **Return Value**: Confirm that the return statement in the `prob_147` function correctly calculates and returns the maximum total mass that can be supported by the bridges.\n\n6. **Testing**: Consider adding more test cases to validate the functionality of the `prob_147` function with different input values.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation seem to align well with the problem requirements and the provided comments. Conduct a thorough review to ensure accuracy and efficiency in solving the optimization problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
