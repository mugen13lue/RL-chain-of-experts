{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem of maximizing the net profit for the grocery store can be formulated as a linear programming model. Here is a summary of the key components:\n\n- **Variables**: Let x be the quantity of banana-haters packages and y be the quantity of combo packages.\n- **Constraints**: The constraints are as follows: \n    - 6x + 5y \u2264 10 (apples constraint)\n    - 30x + 6y \u2264 20 (bananas constraint)\n    - 30x + 20y \u2264 80 (grapes constraint)\n    - x \u2265 0\n    - y \u2265 0\n- **Objective Function**: Maximize the objective function: 6x + 7y\n\nTo implement this model in code, you can use a mathematical optimization library like Gurobi. The provided function `prob_20` demonstrates how to define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints using Gurobi. You can further optimize the model using the `optimize()` method and retrieve the maximum profit using `model.objVal`.\n\nBy utilizing this approach, you can efficiently determine the optimal quantities of banana-haters packages and combo packages that the store should prepare to maximize its net profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
