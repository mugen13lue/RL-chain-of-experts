{"comment": "Optimization:The process of finding the best solution among a set of feasible options to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, the constraint is that the total number of students transported must be at least 500 and that no more than 20% of the buses can be large buses.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a set of linear relationships, subject to constraints. In this problem, we can use linear programming to optimize the number of small and large buses to minimize the total number of buses needed.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
