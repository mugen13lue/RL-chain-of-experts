{"comment": "After reviewing the provided code for solving the optimization problem, here are some observations and recommendations:\n\n1. The code structure is well-organized and follows best practices for defining functions and documenting them using docstrings. This makes the code easy to understand and maintain.\n\n2. The `prob_132` function takes two arguments `table_1` and `table_2`, but these arguments are not used within the function. It seems like these arguments are meant to represent the number of tables set up at each table, but they are not utilized in the function. Consider updating the function to use these arguments appropriately.\n\n3. The objective function coefficients `c`, constraint coefficients `A`, right-hand side of constraints `b`, and bounds for variables `bounds` are hard-coded within the function. While this is acceptable for this specific problem, it may be beneficial to make these parameters more flexible by allowing them to be passed as arguments to the function. This would make the function more reusable for similar optimization problems.\n\n4. The code correctly handles the case where no feasible solution is found by returning a message. This is a good practice to inform the user when the optimization problem cannot be solved under the given constraints.\n\n5. Consider adding more detailed comments within the function to explain the purpose of each step or calculation. This can help other developers understand the code more easily and make future modifications if needed.\n\nOverall, the code effectively solves the optimization problem using linear programming techniques. By addressing the points mentioned above, the code can be further improved in terms of flexibility and readability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
