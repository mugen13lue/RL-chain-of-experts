{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of large cruise ship trips\n- y: number of small cruise ship trips\n\nDefinitions:\n- x: represents the number of large cruise ship trips that the cruise company should use\n- y: represents the number of small cruise ship trips that the cruise company should use\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n- x \\leq 7\n- y \\geq 0.4(x+y)\n- 2000x + 800y \\geq 20000\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- Minimize 20x + 15y\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective form the basis for modeling the problem as a linear programming (LP) or mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to determine the optimal number of each size of cruise ships to minimize the total amount of pollution produced.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
