{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, here is a summary of the optimization problem and the Python code to solve it:\n\n- **Optimization Problem**: The goal is to maximize the total number of units produced while meeting constraints such as bottling at least 1000000 ml of soda, having at least three times more cans than glass bottles, and producing at least 100 glass bottles.\n\n- **Variables**:\n  - Let x be the number of cans produced.\n  - Let y be the number of glass bottles produced.\n\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Production Constraint: 250x + 1000y \u2265 1000000\n  - Minimum Glass Bottles Constraint: y \u2265 100\n  - Minimum Cans Constraint: x \u2265 3y\n\n- **Objective Function**: Maximize Z = x + y\n\n- **Python Code**:\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_250(cans, glass_bottles, required_capacity, constraint2, constraint3):\n    c = [-1, -1]  # Coefficients for the objective function to maximize Z = x + y\n    A = [[250, 1000], [0, -1], [-constraint2, 1]]  # Coefficients for the constraints\n    b = [required_capacity, -constraint3, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))\n\n    return int(res.x[0]), int(res.x[1])\n\n# Example usage\ncans, glass_bottles = prob_250(0, 0, 1000000, 3, 100)\nprint(\"Number of cans produced:\", cans)\nprint(\"Number of glass bottles produced:\", glass_bottles)\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. It calculates the optimal number of cans and glass bottles to produce in order to maximize the total number of units. The constraints and objective function are defined according to the problem requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
