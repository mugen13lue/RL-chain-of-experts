{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, the code seems to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. The variables x and y represent the number of trips by cargo planes and ultrawide trucks, respectively. Both variables are non-negative integers, as specified by the Modeling Expert.\n\n2. The constraints related to transporting at least 200 tires, the total cost constraint, and the limit on plane trips are correctly implemented in the code, as outlined by the Modeling Expert and Parameter Extractor.\n\n3. The objective function to minimize the total number of trips (x + y) is appropriately defined in the code, in line with the objective specified by the Modeling Expert and Parameter Extractor.\n\n4. The code uses the Gurobi Optimization library to model and solve the transportation optimization problem efficiently, demonstrating good programming practices.\n\n5. The function prob_179 takes the number of cargo planes and ultrawide trucks as input and returns the minimum number of trips required to transport the tires, as expected.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and correctly implements the optimization problem. You may consider running the code with sample inputs to verify its functionality and ensure that it provides the expected output.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
