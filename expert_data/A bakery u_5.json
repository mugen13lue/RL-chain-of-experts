{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the code provided by the Programming Expert for the bakery optimization problem. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. The code uses the Gurobi optimization library, which is a suitable choice for solving linear programming problems like this bakery optimization scenario.\n\n2. The function `prob_21` takes the number of loaves of bread and batches of cookies as input parameters, which is appropriate for solving the problem.\n\n3. The variables `x` and `y` are correctly defined as integer variables representing the number of loaves of bread and batches of cookies, respectively.\n\n4. The objective function is set to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as 5 times the number of loaves of bread plus 3 times the number of batches of cookies.\n\n5. The constraints related to the stand mixer hours and oven hours are correctly added to the model, ensuring that the total hours used by each machine does not exceed the maximum limit of 3000 hours.\n\n6. The model is optimized using the `model.optimize()` method, and the maximum total profit is extracted and returned by the function.\n\nOverall, the code provided by the Programming Expert is well-structured and correctly implements the bakery optimization problem. It effectively utilizes the Gurobi library to find the optimal solution for maximizing total profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
