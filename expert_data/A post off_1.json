{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of dual model stamping machines\n- y: number of single model stamping machines\n\nDefinitions:\n- x: the decision variable representing the number of dual model stamping machines to be purchased\n- y: the decision variable representing the number of single model stamping machines to be purchased\n\nConstraints:\n1. 50x + 30y \\geq 300: The total number of letters stamped per minute should be at least 300.\n2. 20x + 15y \\leq 135: The total units of glue used per minute should be at most 135.\n3. y \\geq x: The number of single model stamping machines must be more than the number of dual model stamping machines.\n4. x, y \\geq 0: Non-negativity constraint for the number of stamping machines.\n\nObjective:\nMinimize Z = x + y: The objective is to minimize the total number of stamping machines purchased.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
