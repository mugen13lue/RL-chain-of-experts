It defines decision variables for the number of nurses and pharmacists scheduled, sets the objective function to minimize the total number of workers, adds constraints for total hours and budget, optimizes the model, and then retrieves the optimal solution for the number of nurses and pharmacists scheduled.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
