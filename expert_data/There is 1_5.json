{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem can be solved using linear programming to maximize profit from selling long and short cables. Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Terminology Interpreter**: \n   - **Constraint**: The conditions that must be satisfied include the total amount of gold available, the requirement for at least 10 long cables to be made, and the relationship between the number of long and short cables.\n   - **Objective function**: The function to be optimized is the profit from selling the cables.\n   - **Linear programming**: A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome based on linear constraints.\n\n2. **Modeling Expert**:\n   - **Variables**: Let x be the number of long cables and y be the number of short cables.\n   - **Constraints**: The constraints include the total amount of gold available, the relationship between the number of long and short cables, and the minimum number of long cables to be made.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the profit function 12x + 5y.\n\n3. **Parameter Extractor**:\n   - Extracted Variables: x (number of long cables) and y (number of short cables).\n   - Extracted Constraints: Constraints related to the total amount of gold available, the relationship between long and short cables, and non-negativity constraints.\n   - Extracted Objective: Maximize the profit function 12x + 5y.\n\n4. **Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert**:\n   - The provided Python code uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem.\n   - The objective is to maximize profit by determining the optimal number of long and short cables to produce based on the constraints.\n\n5. **Programming Expert**:\n   - The Python function `prob_14` takes input parameters related to the number of long and short cables, constraints, and returns the objective value (maximum profit).\n   - The function sets up the coefficients for the objective function and constraints, defines bounds for variables, and uses `linprog` to solve the linear programming problem.\n\nBy utilizing the provided Python code and following the constraints and objective function, you can determine the optimal number of long and short cables to produce in order to maximize profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
