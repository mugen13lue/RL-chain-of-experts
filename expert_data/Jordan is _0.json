{"comment": "Linear programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. In this case, it will help Jordan minimize the cost of his diet while meeting his nutritional requirements.\nConstraints:Constraints are the limitations or restrictions that must be satisfied in a linear programming problem. In this case, the constraints include the minimum calorie and protein requirements that Jordan wants to meet.\nObjective function:The objective function is the mathematical expression that represents the quantity to be optimized in a linear programming problem. In this case, the objective function will be to minimize the cost of the diet, which is the total cost of the servings of Rice and Kebab that Jordan consumes.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
