{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, I have identified a potential improvement in the function `prob_22`:\n\n1. The function `prob_22` is correctly formulated to create a linear programming model using the Gurobi library to maximize profit based on the given constraints. The decision variables, objective function, and constraints are appropriately defined.\n\n2. However, the function could benefit from including the return values of the decision variables `x` and `y` along with the maximum profit `obj`. This would provide additional insights into the optimal quantities of regular and tempered glass panes to produce for maximizing profit.\n\nHere is the updated version of the function `prob_22` with the return values of decision variables included:\n\n```python\nimport gurobipy as gp\nfrom gurobipy import GRB\n\ndef prob_22(regular_glass_pane, tempered_glass_pane, regular_glass_cooling_time, tempered_glass_cooling_time, regular_glass_profit, tempered_glass_profit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        regular_glass_pane: an integer, the time required in the heating machine for one regular glass pane\n        tempered_glass_pane: an integer, the time required in the heating machine for one tempered glass pane\n        regular_glass_cooling_time: an integer, the time required in the cooling machine for one regular glass pane\n        tempered_glass_cooling_time: an integer, the time required in the cooling machine for one tempered glass pane\n        regular_glass_profit: an integer, the profit per pane of regular glass\n        tempered_glass_profit: an integer, the profit per pane of tempered glass\n    Returns:\n        obj: an integer, the maximum profit\n        x_val: an integer, the optimal quantity of regular glass panes to produce\n        y_val: an integer, the optimal quantity of tempered glass panes to produce\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create a new model\n    model = gp.Model(\"glass_factory\")\n    \n    # Define decision variables\n    x = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"regular_glass_panes\")\n    y = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"tempered_glass_panes\")\n    \n    # Set objective function\n    model.setObjective(regular_glass_profit * x + tempered_glass_profit * y, sense=GRB.MAXIMIZE)\n    \n    # Add constraints\n    model.addConstr(regular_glass_pane * x + tempered_glass_pane * y <= 300, \"machine_time_constraint\")\n    model.addConstr(regular_glass_cooling_time * x + tempered_glass_cooling_time * y <= 300, \"cooling_machine_time_constraint\")\n    \n    # Optimize the model\n    model.optimize()\n    \n    # Get the maximum profit\n    obj = model.objVal\n    \n    # Get the optimal values of decision variables\n    x_val = x.x\n    y_val = y.x\n    \n    return obj, x_val, y_val\n```\n\nBy including the return values of decision variables, users of the function can easily determine the optimal quantities of regular and tempered glass panes to produce along with the maximum profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
