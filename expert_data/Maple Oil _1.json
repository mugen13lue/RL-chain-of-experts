{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x1: number of tanks of light oil processed\n- x2: number of tanks of non-sticky oil processed\n- x3: number of tanks of heavy oil processed\n\nDefinitions:\n- x1, x2, x3 are non-negative integers representing the number of tanks of each type of oil processed.\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n- 3x1 + 6x2 + 9x3 \\leq 250 (Compound A constraint)\n- 3x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 \\leq 150 (Compound B constraint)\n- x1, x2, x3 \\geq 0\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- Maximize 550x1 + 750x2 + 950x3\n\nThese variables, constraints, and objective form the basis for modeling the optimization problem to maximize the net revenue from processing different types of crude oil while considering the constraints on available compounds A and B.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
