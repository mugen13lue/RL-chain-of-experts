{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (in this case, the number of goat and chicken curry bowls) that minimizes the total amount of curry base used while satisfying the given constraints.\nLinear Programming:A method used to find the optimal solution to a problem with linear constraints. In this case, we can use linear programming techniques to determine the optimal number of goat and chicken curry bowls to make.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this problem, constraints include the availability of goat and chicken meat, the minimum percentage of chicken curry bowls, and the requirement for more goat curry bowls than chicken curry bowls.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
