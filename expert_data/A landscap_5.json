{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, I have identified a potential improvement that can be made to the `prob_284` function. \n\nIn the current implementation, the function takes two arguments `heavy_duty_yard_machine` and `gas_lawn_mower`, which represent the maximum square feet that can be cut by each machine. However, the function does not utilize these arguments effectively in setting the bounds for the variables `x` and `y`.\n\nTo improve the function, you can modify the bounds for the variables `x` and `y` based on the input arguments `heavy_duty_yard_machine` and `gas_lawn_mower`. This will ensure that the optimization problem is solved within the specified limits for each machine.\n\nHere is the updated version of the `prob_284` function with improved bounds setting:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_284(heavy_duty_yard_machine, gas_lawn_mower):\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        heavy_duty_yard_machine: an integer, the maximum square feet to be cut using heavy duty yard machine\n        gas_lawn_mower: an integer, the maximum square feet to be cut using gas lawn mower\n\n    Returns:\n        obj: an integer, the objective value (time required)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coefficients of the objective function\n    c = [2, 5]\n\n    # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    A = [[2, 5], [3, 2], [12, 10]]\n    b = [2500, 450, 2000]\n\n    # Bounds for the variables x and y based on input arguments\n    x_bounds = (0, heavy_duty_yard_machine)\n    y_bounds = (0, gas_lawn_mower)\n\n    # Solve the linear programming problem\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method='highs')\n\n    # Extract the optimal values of x and y\n    x_opt = res.x[0]\n    y_opt = res.x[1]\n\n    # Calculate the objective value (time required)\n    obj = c[0]*x_opt + c[1]*y_opt\n\n    return obj\n```\n\nBy incorporating the input arguments `heavy_duty_yard_machine` and `gas_lawn_mower` into the bounds setting, the function now ensures that the optimization problem is solved within the specified limits for each machine. This improvement enhances the functionality and accuracy of the `prob_284` function.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
