{"comment": "Optimization:The process of finding the best solution among a set of feasible options, in this case, minimizing the amount of Vitamin K in the vitamin mix.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem, such as the minimum and maximum amounts of each vitamin in the mix.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model, subject to linear constraints. In this case, determining the optimal number of cups of each drink to minimize Vitamin K while meeting the requirements for Vitamins A, D, and E.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
