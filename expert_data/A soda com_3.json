The objective function is to maximize the total number of units produced (Z = x + y), subject to the production constraint, minimum glass bottles constraint, and minimum cans constraint. The function returns the optimal number of cans and glass bottles to produce to maximize the total number of units.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
