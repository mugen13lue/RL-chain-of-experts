{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (in this case, the combination of crab cakes and lobster rolls) that minimizes the sailor's unsaturated fat intake while meeting the vitamin A and C requirements.\nConstraint:The restriction that at most 40% of the sailor's meals should be lobster rolls is a constraint that limits the possible combinations of crab cakes and lobster rolls he can consume.\nObjective Function:The objective function in this problem is to minimize the sailor's unsaturated fat intake, which is achieved by finding the optimal combination of crab cakes and lobster rolls that meets the vitamin requirements and satisfies the lobster roll percentage constraint.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
