{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python code for the inventory optimization problem. The code aligns with the formulated Linear Programming (LP) model and effectively solves the problem to maximize profit while considering the specified constraints. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Variables and Parameters**: The variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent the number of phones and laptops to keep in inventory, respectively. The parameters such as profits, floor space requirements, costs, total floor space available, maximum budget, and corporate requirements are appropriately defined.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective function is correctly set to maximize profit by considering the profits earned from selling phones and laptops.\n\n3. **Constraints**: The code implements the floor space constraint, budget constraint, and corporate requirement constraint as specified in the LP model. These constraints ensure that the solution adheres to the limitations and restrictions provided.\n\n4. **Code Structure**: The code structure is well-organized, with clear variable definitions, objective function setting, constraint additions, model optimization, and result retrieval.\n\n5. **Optimization Library**: The code utilizes the Gurobi optimization library to create and solve the LP model efficiently.\n\nOverall, the code effectively implements the LP model for the inventory optimization problem and provides the maximum profit achievable while meeting the specified constraints. Great job on the implementation!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
