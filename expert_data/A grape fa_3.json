The objective function is to maximize the total number of grapes transported (200x + 500y), and the constraints are defined based on the information provided by the experts. The function `prob_190` takes the number of small crates and large crates as input and returns the maximum total number of grapes that can be transported.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
