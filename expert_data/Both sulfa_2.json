{"comment": "Based on the problem description and the comments from other experts, the extracted variables, constraints, and objective are as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of units of sulfate added to the shampoo.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of units of ginger added to the shampoo.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Sulfate Constraint: \\( x \\geq 100 \\) (The shampoo must contain at least 100 units of sulfates)\n- Total Ingredient Constraint: \\( x + y \\leq 400 \\) (The total amount of both ingredients should not exceed 400 units)\n- Sulfate to Ginger Ratio Constraint: \\( x \\leq 2y \\) (There can be at most twice the amount of sulfate as ginger in the shampoo)\n\n**Objective:**\n- Minimize the total time it takes for the mixture to be effective: \\( 0.5x + 0.75y \\) (The goal is to minimize the combined time it takes for both sulfate and ginger to be effective in the shampoo)", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
