The objective is to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced (15x + 18y) subject to the constraints on wood and oxygen availability. The function returns the maximum amount of carbon dioxide that can be produced given the number of processes with and without a catalyst.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
