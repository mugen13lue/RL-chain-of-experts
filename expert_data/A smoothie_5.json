{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variables**: The variables x and y represent the number of acai berry smoothies and banana chocolate smoothies made, respectively. These variables are correctly defined in the code.\n\n2. **Constraints**: The constraints related to the availability of acai berries and banana chocolate, the minimum percentage of acai berry smoothies, and the requirement for more banana chocolate smoothies are correctly implemented in the code.\n\n3. **Objective Function**: The objective function to minimize the total amount of water used (3*x + 4*y) is correctly defined in the code.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The code uses the Gurobi optimization library to solve the linear programming problem efficiently.\n\n5. **Function Documentation**: The function `prob_266` has clear documentation specifying the input parameters and return value.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. You may want to run some test cases to ensure that the code produces the expected results and handles edge cases appropriately. Additionally, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code for better readability and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
