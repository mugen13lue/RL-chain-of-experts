The objective is to maximize the total weight that can be supported by the bridges while satisfying the given constraints. The function `prob_147` takes the number of beam bridges and truss bridges as input and returns the maximum total mass that can be supported.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
