The coefficients of the objective function, inequality constraints, and right-hand side values are set according to the problem constraints provided by the experts. The function returns the maximum number of hands that can be cleaned based on the optimal solution found by the linear programming solver.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
