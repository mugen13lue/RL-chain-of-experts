{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming model for the given problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_254():\n    c = [-25, -6]  # Coefficients of the objective function to be minimized (-25x - 6y)\n    A = [[4, 1.5], [-1, 2], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [110, 0, -20]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='highs')\n    max_grain_weight = -res.fun  # Maximum amount of grain in weight\n\n    return int(max_grain_weight)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(prob_254())\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to maximize the total amount of grain in weight (25x + 6y), subject to the given constraints. The function returns the maximum amount of grain in weight that can be transported given the constraints.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
