{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the given problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_37(mango_cost, guava_cost):\n    c = [-3, -4]  # Coefficients of the objective function to be minimized (-3x - 4y)\n    A = [[5, 3], [-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1/3]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [20000, -100, 150, 0, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='highs')\n    max_profit = -res.fun  # Maximum profit is the negative of the minimum value obtained by linprog\n\n    return int(max_profit)\n\n# Test the function with given mango and guava costs\nprint(prob_37(5, 3))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem and find the maximum profit. The objective function to be minimized is `-3x - 4y` (negative of the profit function to be maximized). The inequality constraints are based on the budget constraint, minimum and maximum mango sales, and the guava sales limit. The function returns the maximum profit that can be achieved.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
