{"comment": "As a parameter extraction expert, the variables, constraints, and objective extracted from the problem statement are as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let x be the number of math workbooks\n- Let y be the number of English workbooks\n\n**Constraints:**\n- x \\geq 40 (At least 40 math workbooks must be made)\n- y \\geq 60 (At least 60 English workbooks must be made)\n- x \\leq 140 (At most 140 math workbooks can be made)\n- y \\leq 170 (At most 170 English workbooks can be made)\n- x + y \\geq 200 (At least 200 workbooks of either type must be made)\n\n**Objective:**\n- Maximize profit: 15x + 17y\n\nBy accurately defining these variables, constraints, and objective, a solvable LP or MIP model can be formulated to determine the optimal number of math and English workbooks that the company should produce to maximize profit.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
