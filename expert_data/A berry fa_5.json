{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the Linear Programming (LP) problem can be formulated as follows:\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n- \\( x_1 \\): kg of raspberries to be harvested at the old farm\n- \\( x_2 \\): kg of blueberries to be harvested at the old farm\n- \\( x_3 \\): kg of strawberries to be harvested at the old farm\n- \\( y_1 \\): kg of raspberries to be harvested at the new farm\n- \\( y_2 \\): kg of blueberries to be harvested at the new farm\n- \\( y_3 \\): kg of strawberries to be harvested at the new farm\n\n**Constants:**\n- \\( C_{\\text{old}} = 300 \\): cost to operate the old farm per day (in dollars)\n- \\( C_{\\text{new}} = 200 \\): cost to operate the new farm per day (in dollars)\n- \\( D_{\\text{rasp}} = 10 \\): kg of raspberries required by the store\n- \\( D_{\\text{blue}} = 9 \\): kg of blueberries required by the store\n- \\( D_{\\text{straw}} = 15 \\): kg of strawberries required by the store\n\n**Coefficients:**\n- \\( P_{\\text{rasp,old}} = 2 \\): kg of raspberries harvested at the old farm per day\n- \\( P_{\\text{blue,old}} = 2 \\): kg of blueberries harvested at the old farm per day\n- \\( P_{\\text{straw,old}} = 4 \\): kg of strawberries harvested at the old farm per day\n- \\( P_{\\text{rasp,new}} = 4 \\): kg of raspberries harvested at the new farm per day\n- \\( P_{\\text{blue,new}} = 1 \\): kg of blueberries harvested at the new farm per day\n- \\( P_{\\text{straw,new}} = 2 \\): kg of strawberries harvested at the new farm per day\n\n**Objective:**\nMinimize the total cost: \\( \\text{Minimize} \\quad Z = C_{\\text{old}}(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + C_{\\text{new}}(y_1 + y_2 + y_3) \\)\n\n**Constraints:**\n1. Harvested quantities must meet the store's requirements:\n   - Raspberries: \\( x_1 + y_1 \\geq D_{\\text{rasp}} \\)\n   - Blueberries: \\( x_2 + y_2 \\geq D_{\\text{blue}} \\)\n   - Strawberries: \\( x_3 + y_3 \\geq D_{\\text{straw}} \\)\n2. Non-negativity constraints:\n   - \\( x_1, x_2, x_3, y_1, y_2, y_3 \\geq 0 \\)\n\nThe provided Python code uses the Gurobi optimization library to solve this LP problem. The `prob_42` function takes input parameters related to farm costs, constraints, and farm production capacities, and returns the minimum cost to meet the contract requirements.\n\nYou can further enhance the code by adding comments to explain the purpose of each section, such as defining decision variables, setting the objective function, adding constraints, and optimizing the model. Additionally, you can consider adding error handling to address potential issues during the optimization process.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
