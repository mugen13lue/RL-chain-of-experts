{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (in this case, the minimum cost) from a set of feasible solutions (different combinations of milk and vegetables) based on certain criteria (meeting the minimum calcium and iron requirements).\nLinear programming:A method used to find the optimal solution to a problem with linear constraints. In this case, we can use linear programming to determine the optimal combination of milk and vegetables to minimize cost while meeting the nutritional requirements.\nObjective function:In this problem, the objective function is to minimize the cost of consuming milk and vegetables while ensuring that the young boy gets at least 100 units of calcium and 50 units of iron per day. The objective function represents the goal that we are trying to optimize.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
