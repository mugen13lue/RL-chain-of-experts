{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, in this case, minimizing the total pollution produced by the cruise company while meeting certain constraints.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this case, the constraints include the maximum number of large cruise ship trips and the minimum percentage of small cruise ship trips.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model. In this problem, linear programming can be used to optimize the number of large and small cruise ship trips to minimize pollution.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
