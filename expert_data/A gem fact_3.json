{"comment": "Integer Programming:A mathematical optimization technique where the variables are restricted to be integers, used to solve problems where the decision variables represent whole units.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to solve the problem, such as the maximum percentage of high intensity drills or the minimum number of low intensity drills.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be minimized or maximized in an optimization problem, in this case, the total number of drills needed.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
