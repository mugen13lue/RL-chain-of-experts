{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the optimization problem described:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_101(alpha, omega):\n    c = [20, 15]  # Coefficients of the objective function (sugar intake)\n    A = [[-30, -20], [-350, -300], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [-100, -2000, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for the variables x and y\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n    return res.fun\n\n# Test the function with an example\nprint(prob_101(1, 1))  # Output should be the minimized sugar intake\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The coefficients of the objective function, inequality constraints, and bounds for the variables are defined based on the problem description. The function returns the minimized sugar intake value.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
