{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, here are some areas for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: It would be beneficial to use more descriptive variable names instead of single-letter variables. For example, using \"num_radio_ads\" instead of \"x\" and \"num_social_media_ads\" instead of \"y\" would make the code more readable and understandable.\n\n2. Function Documentation: While the function \"prob_13\" has a docstring, it would be helpful to provide more detailed information about the function, such as the purpose of the function, the parameters it takes, and the expected output.\n\n3. Error Handling: It is important to include error handling mechanisms in the code to handle any potential issues that may arise during the optimization process. This can help improve the robustness of the code.\n\n4. Code Structure: Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability. This can also help in reusing code segments in future projects.\n\nOverall, the code provided by the Programming Expert is well-structured and follows best practices for optimization problems. By implementing the suggested improvements, the code can be further enhanced for better readability and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
