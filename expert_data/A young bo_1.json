{"comment": "As a parameter extraction expert, the variables, constraints, and objective extracted from the problem statement are as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let x be the number of glasses of milk consumed.\n- Let y be the number of plates of vegetables consumed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Calcium constraint: 40x + 15y \\(\\geq\\) 100 (minimum of 100 units of calcium per day)\n- Iron constraint: 25x + 30y \\(\\geq\\) 50 (minimum of 50 units of iron per day)\n- Non-negativity constraint: x, y \\(\\geq\\) 0 (cannot consume negative quantities of milk or vegetables)\n\n**Objective:**\n- Minimize Cost: $1x + $2y (minimize the cost of consuming glasses of milk and plates of vegetables)\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective form the basis for modeling the problem as a solvable Linear Programming (LP) or Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
