{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using the information provided by the experts:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_218():\n    c = [-2.50, -3.55]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize (-2.50*x1 - 3.55*x2)\n    A = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]]  # Coefficients of the left-hand side of the constraints\n    b = [50, 40, 70]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))\n\n    return round(-res.fun, 2)  # Return the maximum profit\n\n# Test the function\nprint(prob_218())\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to minimize the negative profit, which is equivalent to maximizing the profit. The constraints are defined based on the information provided by the experts. The function returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by the taco stand.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
