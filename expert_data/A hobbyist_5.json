{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem can be formulated as a linear programming model to maximize profit. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Variables**: Let x be the number of model trains to be made and y be the number of model planes to be made.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Wood: 3x + 4y \u2264 120\n   - Paint: 3x + 2y \u2264 90\n   - Non-negativity: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\n3. **Objective Function**: Maximize profit: Maximize 8x + 10y\n\n4. **Python Code**:\n   - The provided Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem.\n   - The objective function is to maximize profit, and the constraints are based on the available units of wood and paint.\n   - The function returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by making a certain number of model trains and planes.\n\nBased on the code provided, you can use the `prob_27` function with the given problem parameters to find the maximum profit. The output should be 240 when tested with the provided parameters.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
