{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using the information provided by the experts:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_242(salmon, eggs):\n    c = [0, 0, 1]  # Coefficients for the objective function [0, 0, 1] to minimize sodium intake\n    A = [[-300, -200, 0], [-15, -8, 0], [0, -1, -0.4], [80, 20, -1]]  # Coefficients for the constraints\n    b = [-2000, -90, 0, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b)\n    return res.fun\n\n# Test the function with initial values\nprint(prob_242(0, 0))  # Output should be 0\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to minimize the sodium intake, and the constraints are based on the calories, protein, eggs limit, and sodium intake requirements given in the problem statement. The function returns the minimized sodium intake value.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
