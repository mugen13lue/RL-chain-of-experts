{"comment": "After reviewing the provided Python code for the optimization problem of the banana company, I have identified a few areas for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: The variables `small`, `large`, and `twice` are passed to the `prob_78` function but are not used within the function. It would be better to remove these unused variables to avoid confusion.\n\n2. Comments: While the comments in the code explain the purpose of the coefficients and constraints, it would be beneficial to include comments that explain the significance of each constraint and how it relates to the problem statement.\n\n3. Test Case: The test case `print(prob_78(1, 2, 2))` does not align with the problem statement requirements. The initial values should be adjusted to reflect the constraints provided in the problem.\n\n4. Objective Function: The objective function `c = [-1, -1]` aims to maximize `x + y`, which is correct. However, it would be clearer to explicitly state this in a comment for better readability.\n\n5. Non-negativity Constraint: While the non-negativity constraint is mentioned in the comments, it is not explicitly included in the constraints. Adding this constraint `x, y >= 0` would ensure that the solution remains feasible.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation are correct, but these improvements can enhance the clarity and correctness of the solution.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
