{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, I have reviewed the code for the diet optimization problem. Here are some key points:\n\n1. The objective function is correctly defined to minimize the total cost of the diet: `3x + 2y`.\n2. The decision variables `x` and `y` are appropriately defined as the number of servings of Rice and Kebab, respectively.\n3. The constraints for the minimum daily calorie requirement and minimum daily protein requirement are correctly implemented as `300x + 200y >= 2200` and `4.5x + 4y >= 30`, respectively.\n4. The non-negativity constraint `x, y >= 0` is not explicitly added in the code, but it is implied by defining the decision variables as non-negative integers.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation align with the formulated linear programming problem. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for defining decision variables, objective function, and constraints in a linear programming model. The optimization problem is solved using the Gurobi optimization library.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the code, feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
