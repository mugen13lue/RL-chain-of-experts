{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, the number of cars processed every hour, subject to certain constraints.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible solutions in an optimization problem. In this case, the constraints are the limited number of power outlets, the maximum units of electricity and gas that can be used.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to find the optimal solution.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
