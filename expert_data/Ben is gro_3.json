{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using linear programming:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_3(apples, pears, constraint1, constraint2, constraint3, constraint4):\n    c = [-2, -4]  # Coefficients of the objective function (profit)\n    A = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1], [-2, 1]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [constraint2, constraint3, -constraint1, 0, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(5, None), method='highs')\n    optimal_profit = -res.fun  # The optimal profit is the negative of the minimum value found by linprog\n\n    return optimal_profit\n\n# Example usage\nprint(prob_3(5, 10, 50, 5, 10, True))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function and constraints are defined based on the problem statement, and the function returns the optimal profit that Ben can achieve by growing a certain number of acres of apples and pears.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
