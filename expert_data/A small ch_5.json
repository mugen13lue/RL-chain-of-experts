{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables x and y represent the number of milk chocolate bars and dark chocolate bars, respectively. The constraints related to cocoa, milk, and the milk chocolate ratio have been correctly defined in the code.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective function to minimize the total production time has been correctly set as 15x + 12y.\n\n3. **Model Optimization**: The code correctly creates the optimization model, adds variables, constraints, and sets the objective function for minimization. The model is then optimized to find the total production time.\n\n4. **Code Structure**: The code structure is clear and follows best practices for defining variables, constraints, and the objective function.\n\n5. **Parameter Handling**: The function `prob_96` takes the number of milk chocolate bars and dark chocolate bars as input parameters, which is appropriate for the problem.\n\n6. **Documentation**: The function `prob_96` is well-documented with clear descriptions of input parameters and return value.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and correctly implements the optimization problem described. It is recommended to test the code with different input values to ensure it produces the expected results. Additionally, consider adding error handling mechanisms in case the optimization model encounters infeasible solutions or errors during the optimization process.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
