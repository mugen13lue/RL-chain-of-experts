{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, here is a summary of the problem and the solution approach:\n\n- **Problem Summary**: The cough syrup company needs to decide how many kids size bottles and adult size bottles to produce in order to maximize the total number of bottles given certain constraints such as the available cough syrup amount, bottle capacities, and production ratio.\n\n- **Variables**:\n    - Let x be the number of kids size bottles.\n    - Let y be the number of adult size bottles.\n\n- **Constraints**:\n    1. At least 50 kids size bottles must be made (x >= 50).\n    2. Total amount of cough syrup available is 25000 ml (100x + 300y <= 25000).\n    3. At least 3 times as many adult size bottles must be made as kids size bottles (y >= 3x).\n\n- **Objective**:\n    - Maximize z = x + y (Maximize the total number of bottles produced).\n\n- **Solution Approach**:\n    - The problem can be formulated as a linear programming model.\n    - The `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module is used to solve the linear programming problem.\n    - The decision variables x and y represent the number of kids size bottles and adult size bottles to be made, respectively.\n    - The constraints ensure that the production requirements are met.\n    - The objective is to maximize the total number of bottles produced.\n\n- **Python Code**:\n    - The provided Python code implements the linear programming model to solve the problem.\n    - The function `prob_68` takes the bottle capacities, production ratio, and available cough syrup amount as input parameters.\n    - It returns the maximum total number of bottles that can be produced.\n\nOverall, the code and approach seem to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. The linear programming model effectively optimizes the production of kids and adult size bottles to maximize the total number of bottles produced while satisfying the given constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
