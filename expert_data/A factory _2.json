{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, the amount of rice that can be transported, subject to certain constraints.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution to the optimization problem. In this case, constraints include the number of horses available, the relationship between medium and large carts, and the minimum number of each cart size required.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. In this problem, we can use linear programming techniques to optimize the number of medium and large carts to maximize the amount of rice that can be transported.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
