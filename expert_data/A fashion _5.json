{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, I have identified a potential issue in the `prob_213` function. The function seems to be correctly setting up the optimization model using the Gurobi library, defining variables, constraints, and the objective function. However, the function signature includes parameters `regular_handbags` and `premium_handbags`, which are not used within the function.\n\nTo address this issue, you can remove the parameters `regular_handbags` and `premium_handbags` from the function signature since the variables `x` and `y` are already defined within the function. Here is the updated function:\n\n```python\nimport gurobipy as gp\nfrom gurobipy import GRB\n\ndef prob_213():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns:\n        profit (int): Maximum monthly profit\n    \"\"\"\n    model = gp.Model(\"handbags\")\n\n    # Variables\n    x = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"regular_handbags\")\n    y = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"premium_handbags\")\n\n    # Constraints\n    model.addConstr(200*x + 447*y <= 250000, \"budget_constraint\")\n    model.addConstr(x <= 475, \"regular_handbags_constraint\")\n    model.addConstr(y <= 475, \"premium_handbags_constraint\")\n\n    # Objective\n    model.setObjective(30*x + 180*y, sense=GRB.MAXIMIZE)\n\n    # Optimize model\n    model.optimize()\n\n    return int(model.objVal)\n```\n\nBy making this change, the function will still correctly solve the optimization problem to maximize the monthly profit without requiring any input parameters. This will ensure that the function is more concise and follows best practices for code readability and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
