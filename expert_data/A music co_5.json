{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, it seems that the problem can be formulated as a linear programming optimization problem. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Variables**: Let x be the quantity of full-weighted keyboards produced and y be the quantity of semi-weighted keyboards produced.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Oscillator Chips Constraint: 20x + 15y \u2264 3500\n   - Production Time Constraint: 1.2x + 1.2y \u2264 6\n   - Non-negativity Constraint: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\n3. **Objective**: Maximize Z = 2800x + 2400y\n\n4. **Definitions**:\n   - x: Quantity of full-weighted keyboards produced\n   - y: Quantity of semi-weighted keyboards produced\n\n5. **Optimization Problem**:\n   - Decision Variables: x (full-weighted keyboards), y (semi-weighted keyboards)\n   - Objective Function: Maximize Z = 2800x + 2400y\n   - Constraints: Oscillator Chips Constraint, Production Time Constraint, Non-negativity Constraint\n\n6. **Code Implementation**:\n   - The provided Python function `prob_220` uses the Gurobi optimization library to solve the linear programming problem.\n   - The function takes input parameters for the quantities of full-weighted and semi-weighted keyboards, as well as the constraints related to oscillator chips and production time.\n   - It sets up the decision variables, objective function, and constraints based on the input parameters.\n   - Finally, it optimizes the model and returns the total revenue generated.\n\nTo maximize the total revenue, you can call the `prob_220` function with appropriate input values for the quantities of full-weighted and semi-weighted keyboards, as well as the constraints for oscillator chips and production time. The function will then calculate and return the optimal total revenue generated.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
