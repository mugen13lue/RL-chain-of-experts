{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using linear programming:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_75(traditional_machine, modern_machine):\n    c = [-30, -40]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize 30x + 40y\n\n    A = [[30, 40], [10, 15], [20, 15]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [500, 6000, 9000]  # RHS of the constraints\n\n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for x and y (non-negativity)\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n    return int(-res.fun)  # Return the maximum amount of tea leaves that can be picked\n\n# Test the function with initial values\nprint(prob_75(0, 0))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to maximize the amount of tea leaves picked (30x + 40y), subject to the given constraints. The function returns the maximum amount of tea leaves that can be picked using the traditional and modern machines.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
