{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming problem to minimize the cost of production for the teddy bear company:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_48(factory_1, factory_2, constraint_1, constraint_2, constraint_3):\n    c = [300, 600]  # Coefficients of the objective function (cost)\n    A = [[5, 10], [6, 10], [3, 0]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [constraint_1, constraint_2, constraint_3]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))\n    cost = res.fun  # Minimized cost of production\n\n    return cost\n\n# Example usage\nminimized_cost = prob_48(1, 1, 20, 5, 15)\nprint(\"Minimized cost of production: $\", minimized_cost)\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The coefficients of the objective function, inequality constraints, and the right-hand side of the constraints are defined based on the problem requirements. The function returns the minimized cost of production for the teddy bear company.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
