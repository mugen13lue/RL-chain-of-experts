{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, constraints include the limited number of motorboat trips and the minimum percentage of kayak trips.\nObjective Function:A function that needs to be optimized or minimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the total amount of time needed to transport all the locals.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
