{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues and the Python code provided, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: Make sure that the variables x and y represent the number of gas grills and electric grills respectively. The constraints x >= 0, y >= 0, x >= y, 20x + 30y >= 150, and 20x + 25y <= 140 should be correctly implemented in your code.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective function to minimize Z = x + y should be correctly defined in your code.\n\n3. **Optimization Solver**: Ensure that you are using the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. Check that the coefficients of the objective function, constraints, and bounds are correctly set up in the function.\n\n4. **Function Documentation**: Make sure to include proper documentation for the `prob_67` function, specifying the arguments it takes and the values it returns.\n\n5. **Testing**: Test the function with initial values to verify that it returns the correct number of gas grills and electric grills to be bought.\n\nBy reviewing these aspects of the code, you can ensure that it accurately solves the optimization problem and provides the optimal solution for the burger chain's grill purchasing decision.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
