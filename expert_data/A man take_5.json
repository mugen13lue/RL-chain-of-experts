{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues and the code snippet you shared, here are some key points to consider for the code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `supplement_A`, `supplement_B`, `constraint1`, `constraint2`, `cost_per_supplement_A`, and `cost_per_supplement_B` are used to pass values to the function `prob_212`. It's important to ensure that these variables are named appropriately to reflect their purpose clearly.\n\n2. **Integer Variables**: The decision variables `x` and `y` are defined as integer variables using `GRB.INTEGER`. This is suitable for this problem as the number of pills should be whole numbers.\n\n3. **Objective Function**: The objective function is correctly set to minimize the costs based on the cost per pill of each supplement. This aligns with the problem statement.\n\n4. **Constraints**: The constraints for iron and calcium requirements are correctly added to the model. Ensure that the constraints are formulated correctly based on the problem requirements.\n\n5. **Optimization**: The model is optimized using `model.optimize()`, which is essential to find the optimal solution.\n\n6. **Return Value**: The function returns the minimized costs, which is the objective value of the optimization problem.\n\n7. **Testing**: The function is tested with the given problem parameters to verify its correctness. Ensure that the function produces the expected output for the test case.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation seem appropriate for solving the given optimization problem. However, it's essential to thoroughly test the function with different scenarios to ensure its robustness and accuracy in minimizing costs.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
