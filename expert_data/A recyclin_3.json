{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, subject to a set of constraints.\nConstraint:In this context, constraints are the conditions that must be satisfied in order to find the optimal solution. For example, the constraints in this problem include the number of available workers, the ratio of small to large bins, and the minimum number of bins required.\nObjective Function:The objective function is the quantity that needs to be optimized. In this case, the objective function is the total amount of recycling material that can be collected, which needs to be maximized.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
