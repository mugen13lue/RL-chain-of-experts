{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of senior citizens employed.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of young adults employed.\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize the total weekly wage bill, which is given by the objective function \\( Z = 500x + 750y \\).\n\nConstraints:\n1. The total weekly wage bill must be kept below $30,000: \n   \\( 500x + 750y \\leq 30000 \\).\n2. At least 50 workers are required daily: \n   \\( x + y \\geq 50 \\).\n3. At least 10 workers must be young adults: \n   \\( y \\geq 10 \\).\n4. The number of young adults should be at least a third of the number of senior citizens: \n   \\( y \\geq \\frac{1}{3}x \\).", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
