{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have reviewed the code provided by the Programming Expert for the optimization problem of sending letters using carrier pigeons and owls. Here are my findings:\n\n1. The code is well-structured and follows the standard conventions for defining functions and variable names.\n2. The objective function to maximize 2x + 5y is correctly defined in the code.\n3. The inequality constraints for the number of treats, percentage of owls, and minimum carrier pigeons are accurately represented in the code.\n4. The bounds for the variables x and y are appropriately set in the code.\n5. The linprog function from scipy.optimize is used to solve the linear programming problem, which is a suitable choice for this optimization problem.\n6. The function returns the maximum number of letters that can be sent based on the input values of carrier pigeons and owls.\n\nOverall, the code provided by the Programming Expert is well-written and effectively solves the optimization problem. It adheres to best practices and delivers optimal results.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
