{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python code that solves the transportation optimization problem using linear programming. Here are my findings and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The code structure is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the problem being solved and the approach taken to solve it.\n2. The variable names `vans` and `trucks` are defined in the function `prob_149`, but they are not used within the function. It would be better to remove these unused variables to avoid confusion.\n3. The objective function `Z = x + y` is correctly defined to minimize the total number of trips needed to transport the chocolate boxes.\n4. The inequality constraints are correctly implemented based on the problem constraints provided.\n5. The `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module is used effectively to solve the linear programming problem.\n\nOverall, the code is well-structured and effectively solves the transportation optimization problem. I recommend making the minor adjustment of removing the unused variables `vans` and `trucks` to improve code clarity. Additionally, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code for better readability and maintainability. \n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
