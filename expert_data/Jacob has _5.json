{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, here is a summary of the problem and the solution approach:\n\n- **Problem Summary**: Jacob has $3000 to invest in his favorite clothing company and favorite tech company. He must invest at least four times as much in the clothing company as in the tech company, with a maximum investment of $500 in the tech company. The clothing company earns 7% and the tech company earns 10%. The goal is to determine the optimal investment amounts to maximize profit.\n\n- **Variables**: Let x be the amount invested in the favorite clothing company and y be the amount invested in the favorite tech company.\n\n- **Constraints**:\n    - Investment Amount: x + y \u2264 3000\n    - Minimum Investment Ratio: x \u2265 4y\n    - Tech Company Limit: y \u2264 500\n\n- **Objective**: Maximize Profit: 0.07x + 0.10y\n\n- **Solution Approach**:\n    - The problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem.\n    - The objective function is to maximize profit, with coefficients -0.07 for the clothing company and -0.10 for the tech company.\n    - Inequality constraints are defined based on the investment amount, minimum investment ratio, and tech company limit.\n    - Bounds for the variables x and y are set to be non-negative.\n    - The linear programming problem is solved using the linprog function from scipy.optimize.\n    - The optimal investment amounts in the clothing and tech companies, as well as the maximum profit, are calculated and displayed.\n\nThe provided Python code snippet demonstrates the implementation of the solution approach using the linprog function. It defines the objective function, constraints, bounds, and solves the linear programming problem to determine the optimal investment amounts and maximum profit.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the problem or solution, feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
