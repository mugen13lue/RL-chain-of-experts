{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of regular fire fighters hired\n- y: number of emergency fire fighters hired\n\nDefinitions:\n- x: the decision variable representing the number of regular fire fighters hired\n- y: the decision variable representing the number of emergency fire fighters hired\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n1. Total hours constraint: 10x + 6y \\geq 300\n2. Budget constraint: 300x + 100y \\leq 7000\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y \\geq 0\n\nObjective:\nMinimize Z = x + y\n\nNote: The extracted variables, constraints, and objective are in line with the requirements of a solvable LP or MIP model.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
