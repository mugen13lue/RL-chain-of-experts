{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming model to solve the given problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_245():\n    c = [20, 15]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize 20x + 15y\n    A = [[-1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, -1], [-2000, -800]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [-7, 0, 0, -20000]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, 7), (0, None)])  # Solve the linear programming problem\n\n    amount_of_pollution = res.fun  # Total amount of pollution produced\n\n    return amount_of_pollution\n\n# Call the function to get the result\nprint(prob_245())\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem defined by the objective function, constraints, and variable bounds. The function returns the total amount of pollution produced by the optimal solution.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
