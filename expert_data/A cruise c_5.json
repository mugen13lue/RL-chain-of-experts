{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have reviewed the Python code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert and the Programming Expert for solving the optimization problem of minimizing the total amount of pollution produced by the cruise company. Here are my findings:\n\n1. The code correctly defines the objective function to minimize 20x + 15y, where x represents the number of large cruise ship trips and y represents the number of small cruise ship trips.\n2. The code correctly sets up the inequality constraints based on the constraints provided in the problem statement and extracted by the Parameter Extractor.\n3. The code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem.\n4. The code correctly bounds the variables x and y to ensure they fall within the specified ranges.\n5. The code correctly calculates and returns the total amount of pollution produced by the optimal solution.\n\nOverall, the code implementation aligns with the problem requirements and constraints provided. It effectively solves the optimization problem to minimize pollution while meeting the constraints of the maximum number of large cruise ship trips and the minimum percentage of small cruise ship trips. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for solving linear programming problems using Python.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
