{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, profit, subject to certain constraints.\nDecision Variables:In this problem, x1 and x2 represent the number of regular and deluxe tacos to be made, respectively. These are the variables that the decision-maker can control.\nConstraint:Constraints are restrictions that limit the feasible solutions in an optimization problem. In this case, the constraints include the maximum demand for regular and deluxe tacos, as well as the total number of tacos that can be made.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
