{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using linear programming:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_178():\n    c = [0, 1]  # Coefficients for the objective function (minimize y)\n    A = [[1, 1], [-0.4, -1]]  # Coefficients for the inequality constraints\n    b = [100, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, None), (0, None)])\n    return res.fun\n\n# Call the function to get the minimum number of bikes needed\nmin_bikes = prob_178()\nprint(\"Minimum number of bikes needed:\", min_bikes)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to minimize the number of bikes needed (`y`), subject to the constraints mentioned by the experts. The code then prints out the minimum number of bikes needed to transport at least 500 people while minimizing the total number of bikes used.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
