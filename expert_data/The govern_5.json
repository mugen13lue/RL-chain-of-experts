{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, I have reviewed the code for solving the water transportation problem using linear programming. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The code structure is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the problem and solution approach.\n2. The variable names `wide_pipes` and `narrow_pipes` are appropriately chosen to represent the number of wide and narrow pipes used.\n3. The objective function `Z = x + y` is correctly defined to minimize the total number of pipes required.\n4. The constraints related to water transportation, the number of wide pipes, and the ratio between wide and narrow pipes are accurately implemented.\n5. The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used effectively to solve the linear programming problem.\n\nOverall, the code seems well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. However, here are a few suggestions for further improvement:\n\n1. Consider adding comments within the code to explain the purpose of each section, such as defining variables, constraints, and the objective function.\n2. It might be beneficial to include error handling mechanisms in case the optimization process encounters any issues.\n3. You could provide more detailed explanations in the function docstring to help users understand how to use the `prob_225` function effectively.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the code will not only be efficient in solving the water transportation problem but also more user-friendly and maintainable.
