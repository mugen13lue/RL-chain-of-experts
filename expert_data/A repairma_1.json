{"comment": "As a parameter extraction expert, the variables, constraints, and objective extracted from the problem statement are as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let x be the number of washing machines to fix.\n- Let y be the number of freezers to fix.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Inspection Time Constraint: 30x + 20y \u2264 5000\n- Fixing Time Constraint: 90x + 125y \u2264 20000\n- Non-negativity Constraint: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\n**Objective:**\n- Maximize Z = 250x + 375y\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective form the basis for creating a solvable LP or MIP model to determine the optimal number of washing machines and freezers the repairman should fix to maximize his earnings.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
