{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, I have reviewed the code for solving the linear programming problem to maximize Mrs. Watson's profit from her investment in real estate. Here are some key points:\n\n1. The variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent the amount of money invested in condos and detached houses, respectively.\n2. The constraints include the total budget constraint, the minimum investment in condos constraint, and the minimum investment in detached houses constraint.\n3. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as \\(0.50x + y\\).\n\nThe Python code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert is well-structured and uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The coefficients of the objective function and inequality constraints are correctly defined based on the problem statement.\n\nOverall, the code looks good and should effectively maximize Mrs. Watson's profit from her investment. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
