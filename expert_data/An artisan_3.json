The objective is to minimize `-5x - 9y` (which is equivalent to maximizing `5x + 9y`). The constraints are defined based on the shaping time, baking time, and non-negativity conditions. The function returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by the artisan.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
