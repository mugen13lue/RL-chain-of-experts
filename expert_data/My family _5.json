{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, it seems that the optimization problem can be formulated as follows:\n\n- Decision Variables:\n  - Let x be the amount of money invested in apartments.\n  - Let y be the amount of money invested in townhouses.\n\n- Constraints:\n  - x + y \u2264 600,000 (Total investment should not exceed $600,000)\n  - x \u2264 200,000 (Amount invested in apartments should not exceed $200,000)\n  - x \u2265 0.5y (Amount invested in apartments should be at least half as much as that in townhouses)\n  - x \u2265 0 (Non-negativity constraint for the amount invested in apartments)\n  - y \u2265 0 (Non-negativity constraint for the amount invested in townhouses)\n\n- Objective Function:\n  - Maximize 0.10x + 0.15y (Profit earned from investments in apartments and townhouses)\n\nThe provided Python code using the Gurobi optimization library seems to correctly implement the optimization problem. The function `prob_25` takes the amounts of money invested in apartments and townhouses as input and returns the maximum profit that can be earned.\n\nYou can use this function by passing the amounts of money invested in apartments and townhouses as arguments to get the maximum profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
