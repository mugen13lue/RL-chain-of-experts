The objective is to maximize the total vitamin D intake (10x + 12y) subject to the given constraints. The function returns the maximum total vitamin D intake that the scientist can achieve by drinking the specified number of orange and apple juice boxes.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
