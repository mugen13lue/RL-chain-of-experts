{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the code provided by the Programming Expert for the optimization problem of maximizing profit from selling wooden elephants and tigers. Here are my findings:\n\n1. **Function Documentation**: The function `prob_23` lacks detailed documentation. While the function signature is provided with parameter descriptions, it would be beneficial to include information about the expected input values, the output format, and any assumptions made in the function.\n\n2. **Variable Naming**: The variables `elephants` and `tigers` in the function signature are not used within the function. It would be clearer to rename them to `x` and `y` to align with the problem statement and mathematical model.\n\n3. **Code Readability**: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The use of comments to explain the purpose of each section of code is helpful for understanding the implementation.\n\n4. **Optimization Algorithm**: The code correctly utilizes the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function, constraints, and non-negativity constraints are appropriately defined.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The function returns the maximum profit as an integer, which aligns with the expected output based on the problem statement.\n\nOverall, the code implementation is correct and effectively solves the optimization problem to maximize profit from selling wooden elephants and tigers. Consider addressing the documentation and variable naming for improved clarity and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
