{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible options to minimize or maximize a certain objective, in this case, the total time needed to transport the fish.\nConstraint:A restriction or limitation that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this problem, constraints include the maximum number of helicopter trips, the minimum percentage of car trips, and the total number of fish that need to be transported.\nLinear programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to optimize the total time needed to transport the fish.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
