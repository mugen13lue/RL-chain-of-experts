{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here is a summary of the problem and the solution approach:\n\nProblem Summary:\n- Ben has 50 acres available to grow apples and pears.\n- He must grow a minimum of 5 acres of apples and 10 acres of pears.\n- The profit per apple is $2 and per pear is $4.\n- Ben can grow at most twice the amount of pears as apples.\n\nSolution Approach:\n- Variables: Let x be the number of acres of apples and y be the number of acres of pears.\n- Constraints:\n  - Minimum Acres: x \u2265 5, y \u2265 10\n  - Total Acres: x + y \u2264 50\n  - Pears to Apples Ratio: y \u2264 2x\n- Objective: Maximize profit: 2x + 4y\n\nPython Code Solution:\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_3(apples, pears, constraint1, constraint2, constraint3, constraint4):\n    c = [-2, -4]  # Coefficients of the objective function (profit)\n    A = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [constraint2, constraint3, -constraint1, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    if constraint4:\n        A.append([-2, 1])\n        b.append(0)\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(5, None), method='highs')\n    optimal_profit = -res.fun  # The optimal profit is the negative of the minimum value found by linprog\n\n    return optimal_profit\n\n# Example usage\nprint(prob_3(5, 10, 50, 5, 10, True))\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem and determine the optimal profit that Ben can achieve by growing a certain number of acres of apples and pears. The constraints and objective function are defined based on the problem requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
