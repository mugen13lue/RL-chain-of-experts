{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- \\( x \\): number of buses to be scheduled\n- \\( y \\): number of personal cars to be scheduled\n\nDefinitions:\n- \\( x \\geq 0 \\): number of buses to be scheduled (non-negative integer)\n- \\( y \\geq 5 \\): number of personal cars to be scheduled (at least 5 personal cars)\n- \\( x + y \\): total number of vehicles scheduled\n- \\( 9x \\): total number of children that can be carried by buses\n- \\( 4y \\): total number of children that can be carried by personal cars\n\nObjective:\nMinimize the total number of vehicles scheduled: \n\\[ \\text{Minimize} \\quad x + y \\]\n\nConstraints:\n1. The daycare has to pick up at least 100 children:\n\\[ 9x + 4y \\geq 100 \\]\n2. Due to pollution limitations, there must be more buses than personal cars:\n\\[ x \\geq y \\]\n3. There must be at least 5 personal cars:\n\\[ y \\geq 5 \\]\n\nNote: The extracted variables, objective, and constraints are suitable for formulating a solvable Linear Programming (LP) model.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
