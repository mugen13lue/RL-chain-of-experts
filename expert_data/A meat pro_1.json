{"comment": "As a parameter extraction expert, the variables, constraints, and objective extracted from the problem statement are as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let x be the number of batches of hams produced.\n- Let y be the number of batches of pork ribs produced.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Machine Slicer: 4x + 2y \u2264 4000\n- Machine Packer: 2.5x + 3.5y \u2264 4000\n- Non-negativity: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\n**Objective:**\n- Maximize Z = 150x + 300y\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective form the basis for modeling the problem as a linear programming (LP) model to maximize profit.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
