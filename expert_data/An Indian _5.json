{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, I have identified a potential issue in the objective function and constraints related to the optimization problem. \n\n1. Objective Function:\nThe objective function is correctly defined as minimizing the total amount of curry base used (6*x + 5*y). However, the objective function should be adjusted to reflect the units of curry base required per bowl of each type of curry. Since each bowl of goat curry requires 6 units of curry base and each bowl of chicken curry requires 5 units, the objective function should be updated to: 6*x + 5*y.\n\n2. Constraints:\nThe constraints provided by the Modeling Expert and Parameter Extractor seem to be correctly implemented in the code. These constraints ensure that the number of bowls made satisfies the availability of goat and chicken meat, the minimum percentage of chicken curry bowls, and the requirement for more goat curry bowls than chicken curry bowls. \n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation seem to align with the optimization problem requirements. However, I recommend updating the objective function to accurately reflect the total amount of curry base used per bowl of each type of curry.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
