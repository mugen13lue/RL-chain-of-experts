{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `x` and `y` represent the number of regular and hybrid vans purchased, respectively. These variable names are consistent with the problem context and should be maintained.\n\n2. **Constraints**: The constraints related to the number of packages and pollutants are correctly implemented in the code. Ensure that these constraints accurately reflect the problem requirements.\n\n3. **Objective Function**: The objective function to minimize the total number of vans (`x + y`) aligns with the company's goal of minimizing the total number of vans needed. This objective function should remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Optimization Solver**: The code uses the Gurobi optimization solver to find the optimal solution. Ensure that the optimization process is correctly set up and executed to minimize the total number of vans.\n\n5. **Function Documentation**: The `prob_73` function should include clear documentation specifying the input parameters, return value, and a brief description of its purpose. This documentation helps improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n6. **Code Structure**: The code structure follows a standard format for defining variables, constraints, objective function, and optimization. Ensure that the code is well-organized and easy to understand for future maintenance.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling mechanisms to the code to handle potential exceptions during the optimization process or input validation.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. However, it's essential to conduct a thorough review to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to best practices in optimization modeling.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
