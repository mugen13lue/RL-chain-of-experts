{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have reviewed the implementation provided by the Programming Expert and have the following feedback:\n\n1. The function `prob_167` is well-defined with clear input parameters and return value.\n2. The model creation using Gurobi is correctly implemented.\n3. The decision variables `x` and `y` are correctly defined as integer variables.\n4. The objective function is set to minimize `x + y`, which aligns with the objective mentioned in the problem statement.\n5. The constraints `x >= 2*y`, `y >= 10`, and `20*x + 50*y == 2000` are correctly added to the model.\n6. The model optimization and retrieval of the optimal objective value are implemented correctly.\n\nOverall, the code implementation is correct and follows the modeling guidelines provided by the Modeling Expert, Parameter Extractor, and Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert. The code effectively solves the optimization problem of minimizing the total number of wagons needed to transport 2000 units of ore while satisfying the given constraints.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the code, feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
