{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, typically maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution to the optimization problem. In this case, constraints include the limited amount of fuel and pollution that can be produced.\nObjective Function:A function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is to minimize the time required to cut the customer's backyard by choosing the appropriate combination of using the heavy-duty yard machine and gas lawn mower.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
