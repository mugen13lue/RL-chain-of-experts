{"comment": "Here is the complete Python code to solve the linear programming problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_11():\n    c = [-0.50, -1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize profit\n    A = [[1, 1], [-0.8, 1], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [760000, 0, -20000]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, None), (20000, None)])\n    \n    return -res.fun  # Maximum profit is the negative of the minimum value returned by linprog\n\n# Test the function\nprint(prob_11())\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to maximize the total profit, and the constraints are defined based on the problem statement. The function returns the maximum profit that can be earned from Mrs. Watson's investment.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
