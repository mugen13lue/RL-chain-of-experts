{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution to the problem. In this case, constraints include the maximum amount of fertilizer and seeds that can be added, the minimum amount of fertilizer required, and the ratio between fertilizer and seeds.\nObjective function:A function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the total time it takes for the lawn to be ready, which needs to be minimized by determining the optimal amount of fertilizer and seeds to be added.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
