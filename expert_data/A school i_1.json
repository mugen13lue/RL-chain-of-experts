{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of small buses\n- y: number of large buses\n\nDefinitions:\n- x: the decision variable representing the number of small buses to be hired\n- y: the decision variable representing the number of large buses to be hired\n\nConstraints:\n1. Transportation Capacity: 20x + 50y \\geq 500\n   - The total transportation capacity provided by the small and large buses must be sufficient to transport at least 500 students.\n\n2. Maximum Large Buses: y \\leq 0.2(x + y)\n   - The number of large buses cannot exceed 20% of the total number of buses (small and large buses combined).\n\n3. Non-negativity: x, y \\geq 0\n   - The number of small and large buses hired cannot be negative.\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize Z = x + y\n   - The objective is to minimize the total number of buses (small and large buses) hired for the field trip.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
