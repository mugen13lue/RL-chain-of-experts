{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have reviewed the code provided by the Programming Expert and have identified some areas for improvement:\n\n1. In the `prob_142` function, the constraints related to the availability of red and blue liquid for experiment 2 are incorrect. The correct constraints should be:\n   - `constraint_3: 5*x + 3*y <= 80` for the availability of red liquid for experiment 2\n   - `constraint_4: 3*x + 4*y <= 70` for the availability of blue liquid for experiment 2\n\n2. The constraints related to the production of smelly gas for both experiments are also incorrect. The correct constraints should be:\n   - `constraint_5: x + 2*y <= 1` for the production of smelly gas in experiment 1\n   - `constraint_6: 2*x + 3*y <= 2` for the production of smelly gas in experiment 2\n\n3. The total production of smelly gas constraint (`constraint_7`) should be set to 10, as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n4. The objective function should be to maximize `6*x + 5*y` instead of `5*x + 6*y` to align with the total amount of green gas produced in each experiment.\n\n5. The comments in the code should be updated to reflect the correct constraints and objective function.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the code will accurately model the problem and provide the optimal solution for maximizing the total amount of green gas produced.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
