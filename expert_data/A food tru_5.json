{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem can be modeled as a linear programming problem with the following components:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of mangos sold.\n- Let y be the number of guavas sold.\n\nConstraints:\n- Budget Constraint: 5x + 3y \u2264 20000\n- Minimum Mango Sales: x \u2265 100\n- Maximum Mango Sales: x \u2264 150\n- Guava Sales Limit: y \u2264 1/3 * x\n\nObjective:\n- Maximize profit: Maximize 3x + 4y\n\nThe Python code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert correctly implements the problem using the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module. The objective function to be minimized is `-3x - 4y` (negative of the profit function to be maximized), and the inequality constraints are based on the budget constraint, minimum and maximum mango sales, and the guava sales limit.\n\nThe function `prob_37(mango_cost, guava_cost)` returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling mangos and guavas. You can test this function by providing the costs of mangos and guavas as arguments.\n\nOverall, the code provided is well-structured and implements the problem correctly according to the modeling details and constraints provided. You can review the code for any potential improvements or optimizations.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
