{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have reviewed the code provided by the Programming Expert for the optimization problem of maximizing the total number of keyboards manufactured by the keyboard manufacturer. Here are my findings:\n\n1. The code is well-structured and follows best practices in terms of variable naming and code organization.\n2. The code correctly defines the objective function and constraints based on the problem statement.\n3. The code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem.\n4. The code correctly calculates the maximum total number of keyboards manufactured and returns the result.\n\nOverall, the code provided by the Programming Expert is well-implemented and effectively solves the optimization problem. I recommend proceeding with testing the function to ensure it provides the expected output.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
