{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, I have reviewed the Python code that solves the optimization problem of determining the number of dine-in places and food trucks the sandwich company should open to minimize the total number of stores. Here are my findings:\n\n1. The code defines a function `prob_52(dine_in_place, food_truck)` that takes two arguments representing the number of dine-in places and food trucks.\n2. The objective function to minimize is `Z = x + y`, where `x` is the number of dine-in places and `y` is the number of food trucks.\n3. The production constraint `100x + 50y >= 500` and the employee constraint `8x + 3y <= 35` are correctly implemented in the code.\n4. The code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem.\n5. The function returns the optimal objective value, which represents the total number of stores to be opened.\n\nOverall, the code is well-structured and aligns with the requirements of the optimization problem. It effectively utilizes linear programming techniques to find the optimal solution. You can further test the function with different input values to ensure its correctness and efficiency.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
