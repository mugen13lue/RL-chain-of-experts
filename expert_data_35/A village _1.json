{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize the total number of bikes needed for transportation.\nConstraint:The restriction that at most 40% of the vehicles can be cars is a constraint that needs to be considered in the optimization process.\nLinear programming:This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to minimize the total number of bikes used while satisfying the constraints related to the number of people to be transported and the vehicle types.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
