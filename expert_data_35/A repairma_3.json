{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, subject to constraints.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to solve the optimization problem. In this case, the constraints are the available time for inspection and fixing.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be optimized in the problem. In this case, the objective function is the total earnings from fixing washing machines and freezers.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
