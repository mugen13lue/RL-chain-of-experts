{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here is the optimized code for solving the investment optimization problem:\n\n```python\nimport gurobipy as gp\nfrom gurobipy import GRB\n\ndef optimize_investment():\n    # Create a new model\n    model = gp.Model(\"investment_optimization\")\n    \n    # Decision variables\n    x = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=200000, name=\"apartments\")\n    y = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"townhouses\")\n    \n    # Objective function: maximize profit\n    model.setObjective(0.10*x + 0.15*y, sense=GRB.MAXIMIZE)\n    \n    # Constraints\n    model.addConstr(x + y == 600000, \"total_investment\")\n    model.addConstr(x >= 0.5*y, \"minimum_investment_ratio\")\n    \n    # Optimize model\n    model.optimize()\n    \n    # Get the optimal profit\n    profit = model.objVal\n    \n    return profit\n\n# Call the function to get the maximum profit\nmax_profit = optimize_investment()\nprint(\"Maximum Profit: $\", max_profit)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `optimize_investment()` that sets up the optimization model with decision variables, objective function, and constraints as per the problem statement. It then optimizes the model to find the maximum profit and returns the result.\n\nYou can call this function to get the maximum profit that can be achieved by investing in apartments and townhouses according to the specified constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
