{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues and the code implementation, here are some key points to consider for the code review:\n\n1. The code follows the modeling guidelines provided by the Modeling Expert, which includes defining decision variables, setting the objective function to maximize the total audience, and adding constraints related to the budget, viewer limits, and ad limits for each platform.\n\n2. The code uses the Gurobi Optimization library to create and solve the optimization model, which is a suitable choice for this type of linear programming problem.\n\n3. The code correctly extracts the variables, constraints, and objective function from the problem statement, ensuring that the optimization model is accurately represented in the code.\n\n4. The code structure is clear and well-organized, making it easy to understand the optimization problem and the solution approach.\n\n5. The function `prob_16` takes input arguments representing the number of advertisements on each platform and returns the maximized total audience, which aligns with the problem requirements.\n\n6. It would be beneficial to include comments within the code to explain the purpose of each section, such as defining decision variables, setting the objective function, adding constraints, and optimizing the model.\n\nOverall, the code implementation appears to be well-designed and aligned with the problem requirements. However, adding more detailed comments and possibly error handling mechanisms could further enhance the code's readability and robustness.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
