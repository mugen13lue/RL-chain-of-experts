{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize the total number of trips required to transport the tires.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible solutions in the problem. In this case, the constraint is that the number of plane trips cannot exceed the number of ultrawide truck trips.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to find the optimal number of trips for planes and trucks.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
