{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here is a review of the code for the fruit optimization problem:\n\n1. **Variables and Constraints**:\n   - The variables `x` and `y` represent the number of acres of apples and pears, respectively.\n   - The constraints are correctly defined:\n     - Minimum Acres: x >= 5, y >= 10\n     - Total Acres: x + y <= 50\n     - Workforce Limitation: y <= 2x\n\n2. **Objective Function**:\n   - The objective function is to maximize profit: 2x + 4y, which aligns with the problem requirements.\n\n3. **Code Structure**:\n   - The code structure is well-organized and follows best practices for defining variables, constraints, and the objective function using the Gurobi library.\n\n4. **Function Implementation**:\n   - The `prob_3` function takes input parameters for apples, pears, constraints, and a boolean flag for the workforce limitation.\n   - The function sets up the optimization model, adds variables, constraints, and the objective function, and then optimizes the model to find the optimal profit.\n\n5. **Optimization**:\n   - The code correctly optimizes the model to find the optimal profit based on the given constraints and objective function.\n\n6. **Example Usage**:\n   - The example usage provided at the end of the code demonstrates how to use the `prob_3` function with sample input values and prints the optimal profit.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. It effectively utilizes linear programming concepts to solve the fruit optimization problem and maximize profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
