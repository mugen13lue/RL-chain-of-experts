{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of acres of blueberries to plant\n- y: number of acres of raspberries to plant\n\nDefinitions:\n- x, y are non-negative integers representing the decision variables for the number of acres of blueberries and raspberries to plant, respectively.\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n- 6x + 3y \\leq 575 (labor constraint)\n- 22x + 25y \\leq 10000 (watering cost constraint)\n- x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- Maximize 56x + 75y\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective form a solvable LP model for maximizing profit in John's berry farm scenario.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
