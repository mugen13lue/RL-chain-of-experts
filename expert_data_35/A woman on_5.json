{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem can be formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the woman's protein intake while adhering to the constraints of calorie intake and protein intake limit. Here is a summary of the problem:\n\n- Variables: Let x be the number of smoothies and y be the number of protein bars.\n- Constraints:\n  - 2x + 7y <= Protein intake limit\n  - 300x + 250y <= 2000\n  - y = 2x\n- Objective: Maximize 2x + 7y\n\nTo solve this problem, your Programming Expert has provided a Python function using the Gurobi optimization library to find the optimal solution. The function takes the number of smoothies and protein bars as input and returns the maximum protein intake value.\n\nYou can review the code to ensure that it correctly implements the problem formulation and constraints. Additionally, you can check for any potential errors or inefficiencies in the code to optimize its performance. If you have any suggestions for improvement or if you identify any issues, you can provide feedback to the Programming Expert for further refinement.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
