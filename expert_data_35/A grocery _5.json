{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the code provided for the problem of maximizing net profit for the grocery store. Here are my findings and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `banana_haters_package` and `combo_package` in the function `prob_20` are not used within the function. It would be better to remove these unused variables to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Model Initialization**: The model is initialized correctly using Gurobi, and decision variables `x` and `y` are appropriately defined for the number of banana-haters packages and combo packages.\n\n3. **Constraints**: The constraints for the problem have been correctly implemented based on the information provided. The constraints for apples, bananas, and grapes are accurately represented in the model.\n\n4. **Objective Function**: The objective function to maximize the net profit by maximizing the profit from banana-haters packages and combo packages is correctly defined as 6*x + 7*y.\n\n5. **Optimization**: The model is optimized using the `m.optimize()` function, and the maximum net profit is extracted correctly using `m.objVal`.\n\n6. **Code Duplication**: The code provided by the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert is identical. It seems like there was a duplication of the code snippet.\n\nOverall, the code is well-structured and correctly implements the optimization problem to maximize net profit for the grocery store. The code follows best practices for modeling optimization problems using Gurobi.\n\nIf there are any specific requirements or additional functionalities needed for the code, please let me know so that I can provide further assistance.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
