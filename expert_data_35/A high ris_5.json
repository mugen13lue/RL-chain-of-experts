{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `new_model` and `old_model` in the function `prob_61` should be replaced with `x` and `y` respectively to align with the defined decision variables.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective function `m.setObjective(x + y, sense=GRB.MINIMIZE)` correctly minimizes the total number of furnaces purchased (x + y).\n\n3. **Constraints**: The constraints defined in the code align with the constraints provided by the Modeling Expert. Ensure that the constraints are correctly implemented to reflect the problem requirements.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The code uses the Gurobi optimization library to solve the linear programming problem. Make sure that the optimization process is correctly implemented and the model is optimized to find the optimal solution.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The function should return the optimal objective value `obj` as specified in the return statement.\n\n6. **Code Structure**: The code structure and organization are clear and follow best practices for defining decision variables, objective function, constraints, and optimization.\n\nOverall, the code seems well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. Make sure to address the variable naming and ensure that the constraints and optimization process are correctly implemented to find the optimal solution.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
