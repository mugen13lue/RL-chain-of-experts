{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- \\( x \\): number of pop concerts\n- \\( y \\): number of R&B concerts\n\nDefinitions:\n- \\( x \\): decision variable representing the number of pop concerts to be held\n- \\( y \\): decision variable representing the number of R&B concerts to be held\n\nConstraints:\n1. Audience Members: \\( 100x + 240y \\geq 10000 \\) (The total audience members from pop and R&B concerts must be at least 10000)\n2. Practice Days: \\( 2x + 4y \\leq 180 \\) (The total days of practice for pop and R&B concerts must not exceed 180 days)\n3. R&B Limit: \\( y \\leq 0.4(x + y) \\) (The number of R&B concerts must be at most 40% of the total number of concerts)\n4. Non-negativity: \\( x, y \\geq 0 \\) (The number of concerts cannot be negative)\n\nObjective:\nMinimize \\( Z = x + y \\) (Minimize the total number of concerts by optimizing the number of pop and R&B concerts)", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
