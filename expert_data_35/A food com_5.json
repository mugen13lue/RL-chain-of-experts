{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the code for the commercial optimization problem seems to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. The variables \\( x_1 \\), \\( x_2 \\), and \\( x_3 \\) represent the number of commercials to run on Pi TV, Beta Video, and Gamma Live, respectively. These variables are defined as non-negative integers, which is appropriate for this problem.\n\n2. The constraints provided by the Modeling Expert are correctly implemented in the code. These constraints ensure that the total number of commercials does not exceed the limit on Beta Video, the proportion of commercials on Gamma Live is within the specified range, and the minimum percentage of commercials on Pi TV is maintained.\n\n3. The budget constraint is also correctly implemented to ensure that the total cost of running commercials across all platforms does not exceed the weekly budget of $20000.\n\n4. The objective function is set to maximize the audience reach by maximizing the total number of viewers attracted by the commercials on each platform. This aligns with the goal of the food company to reach a wide audience within the budget constraints.\n\n5. The code structure is clear and well-organized, making it easy to understand the decision variables, constraints, objective function, and optimization process.\n\nOverall, the code appears to effectively address the commercial optimization problem based on the provided requirements and constraints. You may proceed with testing the code to verify its functionality and ensure that it delivers the expected results. If you encounter any issues during testing, feel free to seek further assistance for debugging and refinement.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
