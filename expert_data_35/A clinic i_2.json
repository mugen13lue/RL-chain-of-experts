{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- Let x be the number of throat swabs\n- Let y be the number of nasal swabs\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n- Time Constraint: \\(5x + 3y \\leq 20000\\)\n- Minimum Nasal Swabs: \\(y \\geq 30\\)\n- Throat Swabs Constraint: \\(x \\geq 4y\\)\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- Maximize the number of patients seen, which is equivalent to maximizing the total number of swabs done, i.e., maximize \\(x + y\\)", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
