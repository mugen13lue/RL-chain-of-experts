{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, the constraints include the maximum number of bus trips and the minimum percentage of car trips.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the total time needed to transport the chicken, which needs to be minimized.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
