{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible options to minimize the total pollution produced while transporting employees.\nConstraint:The condition that at least 300 employees need to be transported and at most 4 buses can be used limits the possible combinations of car-pooling and bus transportation.\nLinear programming:This problem can be formulated as a linear programming model to optimize the objective function (minimizing pollution) subject to the given constraints (number of employees to transport and maximum number of buses).\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
