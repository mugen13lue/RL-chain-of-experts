{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables x and y represent the number of vans and minibuses used, respectively. The constraints ensure that at least 150 kids need to go to school, at most 10 minibuses can be used, and the number of vans used must exceed the number of minibuses.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective is to minimize the total amount of pollution produced, which is calculated as 7*x + 10*y.\n\n3. **Code Implementation**: The code provided uses the Gurobi optimization library to model and solve the pollution minimization problem. The function `prob_173` takes the number of vans and minibuses as input, sets up the optimization model with variables, constraints, and objective function, and then optimizes the model to find the total amount of pollution produced.\n\n4. **Improvement Suggestions**:\n   - The function `prob_173` could be enhanced by removing the input parameters `van` and `minibus` since the number of vans and minibuses are already defined as variables within the function.\n   - Consider adding comments within the code to explain the purpose of each section for better readability and maintainability.\n   - Ensure that the code follows best practices and adheres to the modeling requirements specified in the problem statement and comments.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation align with the problem requirements and objectives. You can proceed with testing the code to verify that it correctly minimizes the total amount of pollution produced by using vans and minibuses to transport children to school.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
