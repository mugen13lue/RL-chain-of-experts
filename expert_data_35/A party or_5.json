{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here is a summary of the optimization problem:\n\n- **Variables**: Let x be the number of limousines used and y be the number of buses used.\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Total number of people constraint: 12x + 18y >= 400\n  - At least 70% limousines constraint: x >= 0.7(x+y)\n- **Objective**: Minimize the total number of vehicles used: x + y\n\nTo address this problem, you can use linear programming techniques to formulate the model and find the optimal solution. The provided Python code using Gurobi optimization library sets up the model, defines decision variables, sets the objective function to minimize the total number of vehicles used, adds constraints based on the problem requirements, and then optimizes the model to find the optimal solution.\n\nYou can run the `prob_239()` function to calculate the total number of limousines and buses used to transport at least 400 people while meeting the 70% limousine requirement. The function returns the total number of vehicles used, which represents the minimized solution to the problem.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the code or problem formulation, feel free to ask.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
