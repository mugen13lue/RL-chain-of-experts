{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of miter saws purchased.\n- Let y be the number of circular saws purchased.\n\nConstraints:\n- Planks of wood constraint: 50x + 70y \u2265 1500\n- Sawdust constraint: 60x + 100y \u2264 2000\n- Non-negativity constraint: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize the total number of saws needed: Minimize x + y\n\nTo implement this in code, you can use the provided Python function `prob_54` that utilizes the Gurobi optimization library. The function takes the number of miter saws, circular saws, and the constraint results as input, sets up the optimization model with variables, constraints, and objective, and then optimizes the model to find the minimum total number of saws needed.\n\nYou can call the `prob_54` function with the appropriate inputs to determine the optimal number of miter saws and circular saws to purchase in order to minimize the total number of saws needed while meeting the woodshop's daily wood cutting requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
