{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: \n   - The variables x and y represent the amount invested in the favorite clothing company and the favorite tech company, respectively.\n   - The constraints ensure that the total investment does not exceed $3000, the amount invested in the clothing company is at least four times the amount invested in the tech company, and the investment in the tech company does not exceed $500.\n\n2. **Objective Function**:\n   - The objective function aims to maximize the profit by considering the returns on investment in the clothing and tech companies (7% and 10% respectively).\n\n3. **Modeling and Optimization**:\n   - The code uses the Gurobi optimization library to model the investment problem and find the optimal solution.\n   - The `prob_8` function takes the investment amounts in the clothing and tech companies as input and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved.\n\n4. **Code Structure**:\n   - The code structure is well-organized with clear variable definitions, constraint additions, objective setting, and optimization process.\n\n5. **Documentation**:\n   - The function `prob_8` is well-documented with clear descriptions of the input parameters and the return value.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem requirements and the provided comments. You may want to test the function with different input values to ensure that it produces the expected results. Additionally, you could consider adding error handling for cases where the optimization problem may be infeasible or unbounded.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
