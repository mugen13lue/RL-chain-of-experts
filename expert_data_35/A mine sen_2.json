{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- \\( x \\): number of small wagons\n- \\( y \\): number of large wagons\n\nDefinitions:\n- Small wagon: A wagon that can hold 20 units of ore.\n- Large wagon: A wagon that can hold 50 units of ore.\n- units of ore: The amount of ore that can be transported in a single wagon, either small or large.\n\nConstraints:\n1. \\( x \\geq 2y \\) (The number of small wagons must be at least twice as much as the number of large wagons)\n2. \\( y \\geq 10 \\) (At least 10 large wagons must be used)\n3. \\( 20x + 50y = 2000 \\) (Total units of ore need to be 2000)\n\nObjective:\nMinimize \\( Z = x + y \\) (Minimize the total number of wagons needed)", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
