{"comment": "Linear programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of requirements represented by linear relationships.\nConstraints:Constraints are restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in a linear programming problem. In this case, the constraints are the minimum number of each colored teddy bear that must be produced daily.\nObjective function:The objective function in a linear programming problem is the equation that needs to be optimized (minimized or maximized). In this case, the objective function would be the cost of production that the teddy bear company wants to minimize.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
