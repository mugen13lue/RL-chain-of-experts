{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, typically by minimizing or maximizing a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, constraints include the minimum number of patties per minute, maximum units of cooking oil per minute, and the relationship between the number of gas and electric grills.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is to minimize the total number of grills in the store while meeting the constraints.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
