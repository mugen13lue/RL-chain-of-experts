{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `x` and `y` represent the number of hamburgers and chicken wraps, respectively. These variable names are appropriate and align with the problem's context.\n\n2. **Constraints**: The constraints related to calories, protein, and carbs have been correctly implemented in the code. These constraints ensure that the workers receive the required nutritional intake.\n\n3. **Objective Function**: The objective function to minimize the cost of the diet has been set up correctly as `$6.5x + $4y`. This objective function aligns with the company's goal of providing a cost-effective diet for its workers.\n\n4. **Model Optimization**: The code utilizes the Gurobi optimization library to solve the linear programming problem efficiently. The model is optimized to find the minimum cost diet that meets the nutritional requirements.\n\n5. **Function Documentation**: The `prob_199` function is well-documented with clear descriptions of the input parameters and return value. This documentation enhances the code's readability and maintainability.\n\n6. **Code Reusability**: The function can be easily reused with different input values for hamburgers and chicken wraps to calculate the minimum cost diet for various scenarios.\n\nOverall, the code implementation aligns with the problem requirements and effectively solves the optimization problem to determine the minimum cost diet for the company's workers. Great job on addressing the modeling, constraints, and objective function aspects of the problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
