{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the LP model for minimizing the cost for the patient consuming pill A and pill B to meet the required dosage of medicine is as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of pill A to be consumed.\n- Let y be the number of pill B to be consumed.\n\nConstraints:\n- Sleep Inducing Medicine: 3x + 6y \u2265 40\n- Anti-Inflammatory Medicine: 5x + y \u2265 50\n- Non-negativity: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize Cost: 4x + 5y\n\nTo implement this LP model in Python using Gurobi, you can use the provided function `prob_35` as a template. This function takes the number of pill A, pill B, sleep inducing constraint, and anti-inflammatory constraint as input and returns the minimum cost.\n\nYou can use the function `prob_35` to solve the optimization problem and find the minimum cost for the patient while meeting the required dosage of medicine. Make sure to provide the necessary input values and call the function to obtain the optimal solution.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
