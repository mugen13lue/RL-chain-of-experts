{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert, here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Decision Variable Limits:\n   - The upper bound for the variable \"y\" representing the number of guavas sold should be adjusted to reflect the constraint that the number of guavas sold is at most a third of the mangos sold. The upper bound should be set as a function of the variable \"x\" (mangos sold).\n\n2. Parameter Passing:\n   - The function `prob_37` currently takes the number of mangos and guavas as input parameters. However, these values are not used within the function. It would be more appropriate to pass the costs of mangos and guavas as input parameters, as these are used in the objective function and constraints.\n\n3. Variable Naming:\n   - The variable names \"mango_cost\" and \"guava_cost\" used in the function signature do not align with the variable names used within the function (\"mango\" and \"guava\"). It would be clearer to use consistent variable names throughout.\n\n4. Comments:\n   - Adding comments within the function to explain the purpose of each section of code would improve readability and maintainability.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the code can be enhanced for better clarity and accuracy in solving the profit maximization problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
