{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- \\( x \\): number of loaves of bread produced\n- \\( y \\): number of batches of cookies produced\n\nDefinitions:\n- \\( x \\): the decision variable representing the number of loaves of bread produced\n- \\( y \\): the decision variable representing the number of batches of cookies produced\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n1. Stand Mixer Hours: \\( x + 0.5y \\leq 3000 \\)\n2. Oven Hours: \\( 3x + y \\leq 3000 \\)\n3. Non-negativity: \\( x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0 \\)\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- Maximize Total Profit: \\( 5x + 3y \\)\n\nNote: The extracted variables, constraints, and objective are suitable for formulating a solvable Linear Programming (LP) model.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
