{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, I have identified a few areas for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: The variables A, B, _30, _100, _50, _120 in the function prob_91 are not used in the code. It would be better to remove them or provide meaningful names if they are intended for future use.\n\n2. Function Documentation: The function prob_91 lacks detailed documentation explaining the purpose of the function, the parameters it takes, and the expected return value. Adding more descriptive comments would improve the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n3. Code Duplication: The code in the prob_91 function is duplicated in both the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert sections. It would be more efficient to have a single implementation to avoid redundancy.\n\n4. Error Handling: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms in case the optimization process fails. Adding try-except blocks to catch potential errors during optimization would make the code more robust.\n\nOverall, the code follows the modeling guidelines provided by the Modeling Expert and correctly implements the constraints and objective function for the optimization problem. By addressing the points mentioned above, the code can be further improved in terms of readability and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
