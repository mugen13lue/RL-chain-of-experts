{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, I have reviewed the code for the vaccine administration problem. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. The variables x and y represent the number of pill vaccines and shot vaccines administered, respectively.\n2. The constraints are as follows:\n   - Constraint 1: 10x + 20y <= 10000 (time constraint)\n   - Constraint 2: y >= 3x (shot constraint)\n   - Constraint 3: x >= 30 (pill constraint)\n3. The objective is to maximize the total number of patients vaccinated, which is represented by z = x + y.\n4. The code uses the Gurobi optimization library to model and solve the problem.\n5. The function prob_148 takes the number of pill and shot vaccines administered as input and returns the maximum number of patients vaccinated.\n\nOverall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem statement and constraints provided. It sets up the variables, constraints, and objective function as specified. The optimization model is then solved to find the maximum number of patients that can be vaccinated within the given constraints.\n\nIf you have any specific concerns or areas for improvement in the code, please let me know so that I can provide further feedback.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
