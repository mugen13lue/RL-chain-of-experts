{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, in this case, minimizing the total amount of gas consumed while delivering 1000 pieces of mail.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this case, the constraint is that at least 50% of the trips must be made by speed boats.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model. In this problem, linear programming can be used to optimize the number of trips of each boat type to minimize gas consumption.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
