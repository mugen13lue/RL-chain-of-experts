{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the implementation provided by the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert. Here are my findings:\n\n1. Both implementations use the Gurobi optimization library, which is suitable for solving linear programming problems like the one presented in this scenario.\n\n2. The decision variables x and y represent the number of elephants and tigers to be made, respectively, which aligns with the problem statement and the extracted parameters.\n\n3. The objective function is correctly defined as maximizing the profit by selling elephants and tigers, with the profit per unit specified for each type of souvenir.\n\n4. The constraints related to the availability of wood and plastic are accurately implemented in both versions of the code, ensuring that the production of elephants and tigers does not exceed the available resources.\n\n5. The non-negativity constraint is also included in both implementations, ensuring that the number of elephants and tigers produced is non-negative.\n\n6. The code structure and logic are well-organized and easy to follow, making it clear how the optimization problem is formulated and solved.\n\nOverall, both implementations are correct and effectively solve the optimization problem to determine the optimal number of elephants and tigers to be made in order to maximize profit. There are no errors or inefficiencies identified in the provided code. Great job by the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
