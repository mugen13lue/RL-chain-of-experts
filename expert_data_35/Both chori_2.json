{"comment": "As a parameter extraction expert, the variables, constraints, and objective extracted from the problem statement are as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let \\( x \\) be the units of chlorine added to the pool.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the units of water softener added to the pool.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Chlorine constraint: \\( x \\geq 200 \\) (There must be at least 200 units of chlorine in the water).\n- Total chemical constraint: \\( x + y = 500 \\) (The total amount of chemicals added to the pool should be 500 units).\n- Chlorine to water softener ratio constraint: \\( x \\leq 2y \\) (There should be at most half as much chlorine as water softener in the pool).\n\n**Objective:**\n- Minimize the total time: \\( 1x + 2y \\) (Minimize the total time it takes for the pool to be ready, considering the time required for each chemical to be effective).\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective provide a clear basis for formulating a solvable LP or MIP model to optimize the addition of chlorine and water softener to the pool.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
