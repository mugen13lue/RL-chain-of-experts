{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the provided code, here are some key points to consider for code review:\n\n1. The problem involves maximizing the total number of customers attracted every hour, which is represented by the objective function 15x + 8y, where x is the number of throwing games and y is the number of climbing games.\n\n2. The constraints defined in the code ensure that there are at least twice as many throwing games as climbing games, at least 5 climbing games, and the total cost of prizes for throwing and climbing games does not exceed $100 per hour.\n\n3. The code uses the Gurobi Optimization library to model and solve the optimization problem. The variables, constraints, and objective function are correctly defined within the model.\n\n4. The code defines a function `prob_231` that takes input parameters for the number of throwing games, climbing games, and constraint values, and returns the total number of customers attracted every hour as the objective value.\n\n5. The function `prob_231` follows a clear structure with appropriate variable names and comments to explain the purpose of each section.\n\n6. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for optimization modeling using Gurobi.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-written and effectively addresses the problem requirements. However, it is always recommended to thoroughly test the code with different input values to ensure its correctness and efficiency.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
