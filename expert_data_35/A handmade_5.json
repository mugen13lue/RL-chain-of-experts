{"comment": "After reviewing the provided code and problem statement, I have identified a potential issue in the objective function. While the objective function is correctly set to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced (x + y), there is a requirement in the problem statement that states basketballs must be produced at least three times as many as footballs. This requirement is not explicitly reflected in the objective function.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to adjust the objective function to reflect the constraint that there must be at least three times as many basketballs as footballs. This can be achieved by modifying the objective function to maximize 3x + y instead of x + y. This adjustment ensures that the objective function aligns with the constraint specified in the problem statement.\n\nHere is the updated code snippet with the modified objective function:\n\n```python\nimport gurobipy as gp\nfrom gurobipy import GRB\n\ndef prob_267(basketballs, footballs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        basketballs: an integer, representing the number of basketballs\n        footballs: an integer, representing the number of footballs\n        \n    Returns:\n        obj: an integer, representing the total number of sports equipment produced\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create a new model\n    model = gp.Model(\"sports_equipment_production\")\n    \n    # Define decision variables\n    x = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"basketballs\")\n    y = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=\"footballs\")\n    \n    # Set objective function\n    model.setObjective(3*x + y, sense=GRB.MAXIMIZE)  # Adjusted objective function\n    \n    # Add constraints\n    model.addConstr(5*x + 3*y <= 1500, \"materials_constraint\")\n    model.addConstr(x + 2*y <= 750, \"labor_constraint\")\n    model.addConstr(x >= 3*y, \"minimum_basketballs_constraint\")\n    model.addConstr(y >= 50, \"minimum_footballs_constraint\")\n    \n    # Optimize the model\n    model.optimize()\n    \n    # Get the total number of sports equipment produced\n    obj = model.objVal\n    \n    return obj\n```\n\nBy making this adjustment, the objective function now aligns with the constraint that there must be at least three times as many basketballs as footballs, ensuring that the optimization problem is correctly formulated.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
