{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, I have reviewed the code for the diet optimization problem. Here are some key points:\n\n1. The variables x and y represent the number of servings of Rice and Kebab, respectively.\n2. The constraints ensure that the diet meets the minimum requirements for calories and protein, as well as the non-negativity constraint.\n3. The objective function aims to minimize the cost of the diet.\n\nOverall, the code structure follows the guidelines provided by the Modeling Expert, Terminology Interpreter, Parameter Extractor, and Programming Expert. The code is well-organized and implements the linear programming problem effectively.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or areas you would like me to focus on during the code review, please let me know.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
