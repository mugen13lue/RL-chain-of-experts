{"comment": "Folate:Folate is a B-vitamin that is essential for cell division and growth. It plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis and repair, as well as in red blood cell formation.\nOptimization:Optimization involves finding the best solution to a problem within a set of constraints. In this context, we are looking to maximize the baby's fat intake while considering the constraints on folate consumption.\nConstraint:Constraints are limitations or restrictions that must be taken into account when solving a problem. In this case, the constraint is that the baby can consume at most 100 units of folate.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
