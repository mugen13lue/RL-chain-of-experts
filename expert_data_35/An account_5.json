{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: Ensure that the variables x and y represent the correct number of full-time and part-time workers respectively. The constraints related to total hours of labor required and budget constraints should be accurately implemented.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective function should be set to minimize the total number of workers scheduled, as specified in the problem statement.\n\n3. **Optimization Algorithm**: The code uses the Gurobi optimization library to solve the linear programming problem. Make sure that the optimization process is correctly implemented and the model is optimized to find the optimal solution.\n\n4. **Function Documentation**: The function `prob_90` should have clear documentation specifying the input parameters and the return value. Ensure that the function description is accurate and informative.\n\n5. **Code Structure**: Check the overall structure of the code for readability and adherence to best practices. Make sure that the code follows a consistent style and is well-organized.\n\nBy considering these aspects in your code review, you can ensure that the implemented code effectively addresses the optimization problem and delivers optimal results.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
