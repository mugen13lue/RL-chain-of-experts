{"comment": "As a parameter extraction expert, the variables, constraints, and objective extracted from the problem statement are as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let x be the number of elephants to be made.\n- Let y be the number of tigers to be made.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Wood Constraint: 50x + 40y \u2264 5000 (Available wood constraint)\n- Plastic Constraint: 20x + 30y \u2264 4000 (Available plastic constraint)\n- Non-negativity Constraint: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0 (Number of elephants and tigers should be non-negative)\n\n**Objective:**\n- Maximize 5x + 4y (Profit maximization objective)\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective form the basis for creating a solvable Linear Programming (LP) model to determine the optimal number of elephants and tigers to be made in order to maximize profit.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
