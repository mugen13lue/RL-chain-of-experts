{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, I have identified a few areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `small_buses` and `large_buses` are passed as arguments to the `prob_158` function but are not used within the function. It would be better to remove these arguments if they are not needed.\n\n2. **Code Duplication**: The `prob_158` function is duplicated in both the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert sections. It would be be better to have a single implementation to avoid redundancy.\n\n3. **Comments**: While the code has some comments, they are minimal. It would be beneficial to include more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. It would be good practice to include try-except blocks to handle any potential errors that may arise during the optimization process.\n\n5. **Documentation**: It would be helpful to include a docstring at the beginning of the function to explain the purpose of the function, the arguments it takes, and the value it returns.\n\nOverall, the code provided is well-structured and follows best practices for optimization problems. By addressing the areas mentioned above, the code can be further improved for clarity and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
