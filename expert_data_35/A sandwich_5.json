{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here is a summary of the optimization problem:\n\n- **Variables**: Let x be the number of dine-in places and y be the number of food-trucks.\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Production Constraint: 100x + 50y \u2265 500 (The company must make at least 500 sandwiches per day)\n  - Employee Constraint: 8x + 3y \u2264 35 (The company only has available 35 employees)\n  - Non-negativity Constraint: x, y \u2265 0 (The number of stores cannot be negative)\n- **Objective**: Minimize Z = x + y (Minimize the total number of stores opened)\n\nThe provided Python code uses the Gurobi optimization library to solve this problem. The `prob_52` function takes the number of dine-in places and food trucks as input and returns the objective value, which is the total number of stores opened.\n\nTo optimize the total number of stores opened while meeting the constraints, you can call the `prob_52` function with different combinations of dine-in places and food trucks to find the optimal solution. The function will return the minimum total number of stores required to meet the sandwich production demand with the available number of employees.\n\nYou can further enhance the code by adding comments, error handling, and result interpretation to make it more robust and user-friendly. Additionally, you can consider testing the function with different input values to ensure its correctness and efficiency.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
