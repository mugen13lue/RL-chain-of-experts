{"comment": "After reviewing the provided code for the chocolate transportation optimization problem, I have identified a few areas for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: The variables x and y are used to represent the number of trips by vans and trucks, respectively. It would be beneficial to provide more descriptive variable names to improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n2. Function Documentation: The function `prob_149` lacks detailed documentation explaining the purpose of the function, input parameters, and expected output. Adding comprehensive documentation will make it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.\n\n3. Error Handling: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. It would be helpful to incorporate error handling to handle potential exceptions that may arise during the optimization process.\n\n4. Testing: While the code appears to be correct based on the problem description, it would be beneficial to include unit tests to validate the functionality of the optimization model and ensure that it produces the expected results.\n\nOverall, the code follows best practices for modeling optimization problems using Gurobi, but incorporating the suggested improvements can enhance the code quality and maintainability.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
