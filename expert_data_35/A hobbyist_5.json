{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, it seems like the problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to maximize profit. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Modeling Expert**: Defines the variables, constraints, and objective function for the linear programming problem.\n2. **Parameter Extractor**: Provides a clear definition of the variables, constraints, and objective function.\n3. **Terminology Interpreter**: Explains key terms related to linear programming such as objective function and constraints.\n4. **Programming Expert**: Provides a Python implementation using the Gurobi optimization library to solve the linear programming problem.\n\nTo solve the problem of maximizing profit from making model trains and planes, you can use the provided Python function `prob_27` with the necessary input parameters. The function sets up the linear programming model, defines decision variables, sets the objective function to maximize profit, adds constraints based on available resources, and then optimizes the model to find the maximum profit.\n\nYou can now proceed to use the `prob_27` function with the appropriate input values to determine the optimal number of model trains and planes to make in order to maximize profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
