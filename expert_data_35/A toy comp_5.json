{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the total number of factories, which is represented by the objective function Z = x + y. This objective function is correctly implemented in the code.\n\n2. The constraints related to toy production and operator constraints are correctly implemented in the code as:\n   - Toy Production: 50x + 35y >= 250\n   - Operator Constraint: 3x + 2y <= 16\n\n3. The decision variables x and y are correctly defined as the number of medium-sized factories and small factories, respectively.\n\n4. The code uses the Gurobi Optimization library to create and solve the optimization model, which is a suitable choice for linear programming problems like this one.\n\n5. The code structure and function implementation are clear and well-documented, following best practices for readability and maintainability.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and correctly implements the optimization problem described in the problem statement. You may want to consider running the code with different input values to verify its correctness and efficiency in finding the optimal solution.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
