{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. The objective function and constraints have been correctly implemented in the code.\n2. The variables x and y have been defined as integer variables, which aligns with the problem requirements.\n3. The optimization model has been set up using the Gurobi library, which is suitable for solving linear programming problems.\n4. The code structure and function definition are clear and well-documented.\n5. The code lacks input validation for the number of pills of Pill 1 and Pill 2, which could lead to potential errors if invalid inputs are provided.\n6. It would be beneficial to include comments or explanations in the code to clarify the purpose of each section for better readability and maintainability.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. Consider addressing the points mentioned above to enhance the code's robustness and clarity.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
