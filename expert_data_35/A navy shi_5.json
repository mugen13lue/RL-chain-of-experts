{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the code provided for the navy ship's staff nutrition problem. Here are my findings:\n\n1. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for optimization problems using the Gurobi library.\n2. The variables x and y are correctly defined to represent the number of salads and fruit bowls prepared, respectively.\n3. The objective function Z = 2x + 8y is correctly set to maximize the potassium intake.\n4. The constraints for the problem, including the requirements for vitamin, fibre, and the proportion of fruit bowls, are correctly implemented.\n5. The model is optimized using the Gurobi library, and the maximum potassium intake is correctly calculated and returned.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be correct and efficient in solving the navy ship's staff nutrition problem. It adheres to best practices for linear programming optimization and delivers the optimal solution for maximizing potassium intake. If there are any specific areas you would like me to focus on or if you have any further questions, please let me know.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
