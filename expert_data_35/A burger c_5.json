{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: Ensure consistency in variable naming. In the code, the variable representing the number of electric grills is named `electric_grills` instead of `electric`. It's recommended to use consistent variable names to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The objective function is correctly defined as minimizing the total number of grills in the store. This aligns with the problem requirements and the objective specified in the comments.\n\n3. **Constraints**: The constraints related to cooking capacity, oil usage, and the limit on the number of electric grills are correctly implemented in the code. These constraints are crucial for ensuring that the solution meets the specified requirements.\n\n4. **Optimization Solver**: The code uses the Gurobi optimization solver to find the optimal solution to the problem. This is a suitable choice for solving optimization problems efficiently.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The function `prob_67` returns the minimum number of grills in the store as an integer. This aligns with the expected output based on the objective of the problem.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements and constraints. You may proceed with testing the code to verify that it provides the correct solution for the given optimization problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
