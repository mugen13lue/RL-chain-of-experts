{"comment": "Linear programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. It involves optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\nObjective function:The objective function in a linear programming problem is the mathematical expression that needs to be maximized or minimized. In this case, the objective function would be the total cost of Bob's diet.\nConstraints:Constraints are the limitations or restrictions that must be satisfied in a linear programming problem. In this case, the constraints would be the minimum daily requirements of calories and protein that Bob wants to meet.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
