{"comment": "Constraint:In this context, constraints refer to the limitations or restrictions on the resources available for making art pieces, such as the quantities of paint, glitter, and glue.\nObjective function:The objective function is a mathematical expression that represents the goal of the optimization problem, which in this case is to maximize profit by determining the number of large and small art pieces to make.\nLinear programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. In this problem, we can use linear programming techniques to determine the optimal number of large and small art pieces to produce.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
