{"comment": "Optimization:The process of finding the best solution among a set of feasible options to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, the constraint is that the total number of students must be transported and the maximum percentage of large buses allowed.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a set of linear relationships, subject to constraints. In this problem, we can use linear programming to optimize the number of small and large buses to minimize the total number of buses needed.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
