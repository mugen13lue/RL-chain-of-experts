{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `long` and `short_cables` in the function `prob_14` should be renamed to `long_cables` and `short_cables` to maintain consistency with the problem statement and the extracted variables.\n\n2. **Constraint Values**: The function `prob_14` currently takes constraint values as input arguments, but these values are not used within the function. It would be more appropriate to remove these arguments since the constraints are already defined within the function.\n\n3. **Objective Function**: The objective function `12*x + 5*y` is correctly set to maximize profit, as per the problem statement and the extracted objective.\n\n4. **Constraint Implementation**: The constraints `10*x + 7*y <= 1000`, `y >= 5*x`, and `x >= 10` are correctly implemented in the model, as per the problem statement and the extracted constraints.\n\n5. **Optimization**: The model is optimized using `model.optimize()`, and the objective value is correctly retrieved using `model.objVal`.\n\n6. **Code Structure**: The code structure and organization are clear and follow best practices for using the Gurobi optimization library.\n\nOverall, the code implementation aligns well with the problem requirements and the provided modeling information. You may consider making minor adjustments to variable names and removing unnecessary constraint value arguments for a more streamlined implementation.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
