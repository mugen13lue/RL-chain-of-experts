{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (minimum number of vehicles) from a set of feasible solutions (combinations of limousines and buses) based on certain criteria (transporting at least 400 people and having at least 70% limousines).\nConstraint:In this problem, the constraints are the minimum number of people to be transported (400) and the requirement that at least 70% of the vehicles must be limousines.\nLinear programming:This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to minimize the total number of vehicles used subject to the constraints of carrying at least 400 people and having at least 70% limousines.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
