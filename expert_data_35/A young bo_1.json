{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (in this case, the minimum cost) from a set of feasible options.\nConstraints:The conditions that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this case, the constraints are the minimum daily requirements of calcium and iron.\nLinear programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. In this case, we can use linear programming to minimize the cost of the boy's diet while meeting his nutritional requirements.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
