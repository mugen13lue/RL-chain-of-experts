{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, the code for solving the optimization problem seems to be well-structured and follows best practices in linear programming.\n\nHere are some key points to consider in the code:\n1. The decision variables x and y represent the number of wide trails and narrow trails, respectively.\n2. The constraints ensure that the park does not exceed the maximum number of wide trails, the total number of visitors per day, and enforces non-negativity for the number of trails.\n3. The objective function aims to minimize the total amount of garbage produced by the trails.\n4. The code uses the Gurobi optimization library to define the model, decision variables, constraints, objective function, and optimize the model to find the optimal solution.\n\nOverall, the code structure aligns with the problem requirements and the comments provided by your colleagues. It is recommended to test the code with different scenarios to ensure its correctness and efficiency in solving the optimization problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
