This code defines a function `prob_275` that takes the initial amounts of chemical A and chemical B as input, formulates an optimization problem using Gurobi, and returns the total time taken for the mixed bread to be ready as the output. The variables, constraints, and objective function are set up according to the problem requirements and the insights provided by your colleagues. The code is structured to efficiently solve the optimization problem and minimize the total time while satisfying the given constraints.
