This code defines a linear programming model to maximize profit for Forest Paper by producing graph paper and music paper within the constraints of machine availability and non-negativity. The decision variables, objective function, and constraints are correctly implemented based on the problem description and expert insights. The code is structured, optimized, and returns the maximum profit value achievable by the company.
