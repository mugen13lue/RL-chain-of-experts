The final code utilizes the Gurobi optimization library to create and solve the optimization model for the given problem. It correctly defines the decision variables, objective function, and constraints based on the problem requirements. The objective is to minimize the total number of animals used while ensuring that the minimum number of packages is delivered and the total units of food are not exceeded. The code is well-structured and should be able to determine the optimal number of camels and horses to minimize the total number of animals used for package delivery.
