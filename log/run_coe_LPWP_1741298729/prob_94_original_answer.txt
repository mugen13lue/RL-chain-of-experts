This code incorporates the insights provided by the modeling expert, terminology interpreter, parameter extractor, programming expert, modeling knowledge supplement expert, and code reviewer. It defines the decision variables, sets the objective function to maximize the rare compound produced, adds the necessary constraints, and optimizes the model using the Gurobi optimization library. The final code is well-structured and aligned with the problem statement and requirements.
