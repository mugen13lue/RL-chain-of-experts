```python
import gurobipy as gp
from gurobipy import GRB

def prob_208():
    """
    Returns:
        obj: an integer, representing the objective value (minimized cost)
    """
    model = gp.Model("health_supplements")

    # Define decision variables
    x = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name="x")  # servings of health supplement A
    y = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name="y")  # servings of health supplement B

    # Set objective function
    model.setObjective(14*x + 25*y, sense=GRB.MINIMIZE)

    # Add constraints
    model.addConstr(30*x + 60*y >= 400, "calcium_constraint")
    model.addConstr(50*x + 10*y >= 50, "magnesium_constraint")

    # Optimize model
    model.optimize()

    # Get objective value
    obj = model.objVal

    return obj
```
The final code optimizes the servings of health supplements A and B to minimize the daily cost while meeting the patient's requirements for Calcium and Magnesium. The code follows the guidelines for linear programming and incorporates the insights provided by various experts in the field.
