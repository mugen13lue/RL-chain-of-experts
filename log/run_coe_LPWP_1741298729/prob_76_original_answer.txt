This code utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to minimize the total production time while satisfying constraints related to available slices of bread, cheese, and the minimum number of heavy grilled cheese sandwiches. The function `prob_76` takes the number of light and heavy grilled cheese sandwiches as input and returns the total production time for the optimal solution.
