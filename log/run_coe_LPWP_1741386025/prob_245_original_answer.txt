```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_245():
    c = [20, 15]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize
    A = [[2000, 800], [-1, -1], [0, -0.6]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints
    b = [20000, -7, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='highs')
    amount_of_pollution = res.fun  # Total amount of pollution produced

    return amount_of_pollution
```

This code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem and minimize the total amount of pollution produced by choosing the number of large and small cruise ship trips. The coefficients of the objective function, inequality constraints, and right-hand side values are defined accordingly. The result is then returned as the total amount of pollution produced.
