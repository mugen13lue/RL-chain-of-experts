This code implements a linear programming model to solve the given problem of minimizing the total number of concerts while meeting the constraints provided by the experts. The function takes the number of pop and R&B concerts, audience size constraint, practice days constraint, and maximum percentage of R&B concerts as input parameters. The objective function is to minimize the total number of concerts (x + y) subject to the specified constraints. The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to find the optimal solution.
