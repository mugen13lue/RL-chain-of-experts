This code implements the linear programming model to solve the optimization problem of minimizing the total amount of water required to hydrate the garden bed. The objective function is to minimize 10x + 6y, subject to the given constraints on the number of bags of subsoil and topsoil, water requirements, and the proportion of topsoil. The function `prob_227` takes the number of bags of subsoil and topsoil as input and returns the minimized amount of water required.
