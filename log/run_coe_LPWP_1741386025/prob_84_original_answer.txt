This code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Expert, Parameter Extractor, Programming Expert, Terminology Interpreter, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, and Code Reviewer. It defines the decision variables, constraints, and objective function accurately to solve the problem of maximizing the total amount of electricity produced through experiments alpha and beta. The code utilizes the Gurobi optimization library to implement a linear programming model and find the optimal solution.
