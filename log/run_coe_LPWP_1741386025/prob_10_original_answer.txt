This code implements the linear programming model to minimize the amount of vitamin D in the plant nutrition while satisfying the constraints on the minimum requirements for nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and the maximum limit for vitamin A. The code structure is well-designed and follows the recommendations provided by the experts.
