```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_60():
    c = [1, 1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize total number of snow removers (x + y)

    A = [[-6, -10], [120, 250]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints
    b = [-300, 6500]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints

    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for x and y (non-negativity constraint)

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')

    return res.fun  # Return the minimized total number of snow removers
```
The final code provided above accurately addresses the snow remover optimization problem by minimizing the total number of snow removers required to meet the snow removal needs within the specified constraints. The objective function has been updated to correctly minimize the total number of snow removers (x + y), and the code utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem.
