```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_180():
    c = [-40, -100]  # Coefficients of the objective function to be minimized
    A = [[1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 0], [-2, 1]]  # Coefficients of the left-hand side of constraints
    b = [25, 10, 30, 0]  # Right-hand side of constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, 30), (5, 10)], method='highs')

    return int(-res.fun)  # Return the maximum amount of glacial water that can be transported
```
This code utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem with the given objective function, constraints, and variable bounds. It maximizes the total amount of glacial water that can be transported by the water salesman.
