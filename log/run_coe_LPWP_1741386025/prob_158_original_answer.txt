```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_158():
    c = [1, 1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize x + y

    A = [[-20, -50], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints
    b = [-500, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints

    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for variables x and y

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')

    return res.fun
```

This Python code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to minimize the total number of buses, subject to the constraints provided by the modeling expert. The function returns the optimal value of the objective function, which represents the minimum total number of buses needed to transport at least 500 students while satisfying the constraints.
