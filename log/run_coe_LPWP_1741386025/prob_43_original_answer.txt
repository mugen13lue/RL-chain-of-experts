This code defines a function `prob_43` that solves the linear programming problem to minimize the cost of Jordan's diet consisting of Kebabs and Rice. The function uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to find the minimized cost based on the cost coefficients, constraint coefficients, and non-negativity bounds. The function returns the minimized cost of the diet.
