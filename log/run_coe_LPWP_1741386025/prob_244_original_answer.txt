This final code incorporates the insights provided by various experts, including the formulation of variables, constraints, and the objective function. It uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem and determine the optimal number of chop saws and steel cutters to purchase in order to minimize the total number of metal-working equipment needed.
