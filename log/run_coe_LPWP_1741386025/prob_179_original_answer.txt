This code implements the optimization problem described by your colleagues, where the objective is to minimize the total number of trips required to transport the tires efficiently. The function `prob_179` takes the number of cargo planes and ultrawide trucks as input and returns the minimum number of trips needed. The code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem efficiently.
