This code incorporates the insights provided by the modeling expert, programming expert, and code reviewer. It defines the variables, constraints, and objective function as per the problem description and modeling requirements. The code uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem and returns the maximum total number of bottles that can be produced.
