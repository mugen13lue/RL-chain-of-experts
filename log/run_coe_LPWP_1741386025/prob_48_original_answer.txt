This code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Expert, Terminology Interpreter, Parameter Extractor, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, Programming Expert, and Code Reviewer. It defines the linear programming problem to minimize the cost of teddy bear production based on the constraints and objective function specified. The code utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` library to solve the optimization problem and returns the minimized cost of production.
