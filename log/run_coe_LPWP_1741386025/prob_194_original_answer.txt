This code implements the linear programming problem to maximize the total amount of snow that can be transported using small and large trucks, considering the constraints provided by the problem description and the insights from various experts. The objective function is to maximize 30x + 50y, where x is the number of small trucks and y is the number of large trucks. The code correctly sets up the constraints and uses the linprog function from scipy.optimize to find the optimal solution. The function returns the maximum amount of snow that can be transported based on the optimal values of small_trucks and large_trucks.
