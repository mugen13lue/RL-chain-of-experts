This code incorporates the insights provided by various experts, including the modeling constraints, objective function, and the use of the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem. The code is optimized for maximizing the total amount of mail that can be delivered while considering the constraints specified in the problem description.
