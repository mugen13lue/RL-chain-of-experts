This code implements the meal delivery optimization problem using linear programming with the objective function, constraints, and bounds provided by the experts. It utilizes the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to find the optimal values for electric bikes and scooters to maximize the number of meals that can be delivered. The code is well-structured, aligns with the problem requirements, and provides the expected output.
