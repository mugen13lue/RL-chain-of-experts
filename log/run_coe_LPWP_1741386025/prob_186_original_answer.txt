This code defines a function `prob_186` that takes the number of cows and elephants as input, creates a Linear Programming (LP) problem using the PuLP library, sets decision variables, adds constraints based on the problem description, sets the objective function to minimize the number of animals, solves the problem, and returns the minimum number of animals needed to transport at least 1000 bricks.
