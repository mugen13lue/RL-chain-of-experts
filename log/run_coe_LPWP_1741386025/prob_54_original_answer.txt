This code utilizes linear programming to solve the woodshop problem efficiently by minimizing the total number of saws needed. The objective function, constraints, and optimization process are all well-defined based on the problem statement and expert insights. The final code provides a clear and effective solution to determine the optimal number of miter saws and circular saws to purchase.
