This code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Expert, Parameter Extractor, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, and Code Reviewer. It correctly models the problem, sets up the constraints and objective function, and uses linear programming to minimize the total number of vehicles needed for the daycare center. The function `prob_280` takes the number of buses and personal cars as input and returns the optimal total number of vehicles required.
