The final code provided above is a Python function `prob_3` that uses linear programming optimization with the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the problem of maximizing profit for growing apples and pears on an orchard. The function takes input parameters for the number of acres of apples, pears, total available land, minimum required acres of apples and pears, and a boolean indicating whether pears should be at most twice the apples. The objective is to maximize profit, where the profit per apple is $2 and the profit per pear is $4. The function returns the optimal profit value.
