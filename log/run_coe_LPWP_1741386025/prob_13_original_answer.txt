```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_13():
    c = [-60500, -50000]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize exposure
    A = [[5000, 9150], [-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]  # Coefficients of the constraints
    b = [250000, -15, 40, -35, 1000]  # Right-hand side of the constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='highs')
    max_exposure = -res.fun  # Maximum exposure achieved
    radio_ads = res.x[0]  # Number of radio ads
    social_media_ads = res.x[1]  # Number of social media ads

    return max_exposure, radio_ads, social_media_ads
```

This code incorporates the insights provided by various experts, including the variable definitions, constraints, and objective function. It uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem and find the optimal number of radio ads and social media ads to maximize exposure within the budget constraints. The results are then returned for further analysis.
