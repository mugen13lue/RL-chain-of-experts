```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_113(children_vaccines, adult_vaccines):
    c = [50, 75]  # Coefficients of the objective function (fever suppressant)
    A = [[50, 75], [-1, -1], [-0.3, 0.3]]  # Coefficients of the constraints
    b = [20000, -50, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(50, None), (0, None)])

    return res.fun
```
The final code incorporates the insights provided by the experts in modeling, parameter extraction, terminology interpretation, modeling knowledge supplementation, and programming. It correctly formulates the linear programming problem to minimize the amount of fever suppressant used while meeting the constraints related to the number of children's and adult vaccines to be produced.
