```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_75(traditional_machine, modern_machine):
    c = [-30, -40]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize 30x + 40y

    A = [[30, 40], [10, 15], [20, 15]]  # Coefficients of the constraints
    b = [500, 6000, 9000]  # RHS of the constraints

    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for x and y (non-negativity)

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')

    return int(-res.fun)  # Return the maximum amount of tea leaves that can be picked
```
This code defines the `prob_75` function that takes the number of acres used for the traditional and modern machines as input parameters. It sets up the objective function and constraints based on the problem requirements and uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The function returns the maximum amount of tea leaves that can be picked using the traditional and modern machines.
