This code implements the linear programming problem to minimize the cost of production for the teddy bear company. The objective function is to minimize the total cost, and the constraints ensure the production meets the daily demand requirements for black, white, and brown teddy bears. The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to solve the problem and return the minimized cost.
