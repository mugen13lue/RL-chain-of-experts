This code accurately implements the optimization problem provided by considering the constraints and objective function specified by the experts. The `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module is used to solve the linear programming problem and determine the optimal values for the number of limousines and buses to minimize the total number of vehicles used. The code is well-structured and aligns with the problem requirements outlined by the experts in various fields.
