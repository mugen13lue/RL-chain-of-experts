```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_11():
    c = [-0.50, -1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize profit
    A = [[1, 1], [-0.8, 1], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints
    b = [760000, 0, -20000]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, None), (20000, None)])
    
    return -res.fun  # Maximum profit is the negative of the minimum value returned by linprog
```
This code effectively solves the linear programming problem to maximize the total profit earned from Mrs. Watson's investment in real estate. It considers the constraints provided by the experts and uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module. The objective function is to maximize the total profit, and the constraints are correctly defined to ensure the solution meets all requirements.
