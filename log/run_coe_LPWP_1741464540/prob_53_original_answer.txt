This code defines a function `prob_53` that takes the number of processes of type A and B as input arguments and returns the maximum number of coins that can be plated while maximizing the total number of coins plated within the constraints of available gold and wires. The function uses linear programming optimization with the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module.
