This code incorporates the insights provided by the Terminology Interpreter, Parameter Extractor, Modeling Expert, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, and Code Reviewer. It correctly defines the variables, constraints, and objective function to solve the shipping problem efficiently using the Gurobi library. The function `prob_196` takes the number of large and small ships as input and returns the minimum number of ships required to transport the specified number of containers while satisfying the constraints.
