```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_221():
    c = [-450, -1200]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize (-450x - 1200y)
    A = [[1, 1], [550, 2000]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints
    b = [300, 400000]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None), method='highs')

    x = int(res.x[0])  # Number of personal licenses produced
    y = int(res.x[1])  # Number of commercial licenses produced
    objective_value = -int(res.fun)  # Maximum profit

    return x, y, objective_value
```
This final code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Expert, Parameter Extractor, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, and Programming Expert. It formulates the linear programming problem correctly, uses the `linprog` function to solve it, and extracts the optimal solution for the number of personal and commercial licenses to produce in order to maximize profit while satisfying the constraints. The code is well-structured, adheres to best practices, and provides the expected output.
