This code incorporates the insights and suggestions provided by the experts in modeling, parameter extraction, terminology interpretation, and code review. It formulates the problem as a linear programming model using Gurobi, defines decision variables, sets the objective function to maximize the amount of rice transported, adds constraints based on the problem requirements, optimizes the model, and returns the maximum amount of rice that can be transported.
