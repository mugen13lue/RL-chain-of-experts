This code optimizes the profit by determining the number of carrots and cucumbers to be sold each month based on the given constraints. The objective is to maximize the profit, considering the budget constraint, the number of cucumbers constraint, and the number of carrots sold constraint. The decision variables are the number of carrots and cucumbers sold, both integers. The code uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem.
