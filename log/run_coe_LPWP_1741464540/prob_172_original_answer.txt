This code defines a function `prob_172` that takes the number of bus trips and car trips as input, formulates the linear programming problem based on the constraints and objective provided, and then uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to find the optimal solution that minimizes the total time needed to transport the chickens.
