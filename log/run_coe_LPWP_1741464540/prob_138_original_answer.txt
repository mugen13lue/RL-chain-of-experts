This code implements the linear programming model for the given problem to maximize the number of people that can be treated. The function `prob_138` takes no arguments and returns the maximum number of people that can be treated based on the optimal values of doses for medicine A and medicine B. The constraints and objective function are defined within the function to solve the optimization problem efficiently.
