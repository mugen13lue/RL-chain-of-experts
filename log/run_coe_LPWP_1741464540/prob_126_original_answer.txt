The final code incorporates the insights provided by the experts in modeling, parameter extraction, terminology interpretation, modeling knowledge, and programming. It formulates the linear programming problem based on the variables, constraints, and objective defined by the experts, and uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the problem and minimize the total time needed to produce the required amounts of eye cream and foot cream.
