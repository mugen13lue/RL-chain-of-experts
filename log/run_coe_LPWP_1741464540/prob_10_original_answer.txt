This code utilizes linear programming to solve the given problem of minimizing the amount of vitamin D in the plant nutrition while satisfying the constraints related to nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and vitamin A. The corrected values for the inequality constraints have been implemented to ensure the accurate representation of the problem.
