This code defines a function `prob_219` that sets up a Linear Programming model using the Gurobi optimization library to maximize profit from producing math and English workbooks. The variables, constraints, and objective function are accurately defined based on the problem statement and insights provided by various experts. The function takes the number of math and English workbooks as input and returns the optimal profit value.
