The final code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Expert, Parameter Extractor, Terminology Interpreter, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, and Code Reviewer. It defines the decision variables, objective function, constraints, and optimization process using the Gurobi optimization library. The function `prob_18` takes the amounts of Feed A and Feed B as inputs and returns the minimum cost of the mixture.
