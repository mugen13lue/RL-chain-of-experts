This code formulates a linear programming problem to maximize the number of fish that can be transported by a fishery using local sled dogs and trucks, considering different capabilities and costs per trip. The function `prob_0` takes input parameters for DogCapability, TruckCapability, DogCost, TruckCost, and MaxBudget, and returns the amount of fish transported after solving the linear programming model.
