This code implements the optimization model for the given problem as discussed by the experts. It defines the objective function, constraints, and uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem and obtain the total number of transportation units required to transport at least 600 people per hour while minimizing the number of units.
