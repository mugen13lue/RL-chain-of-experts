    # Coefficients of the objective function
    c = [-350, -600]  # We are maximizing profit, so we use negative values

    b = [140, 20, 30, 0]

    x_bounds = (20, None)
    y_bounds = (30, None)
    
    # Solve the linear programming problem
    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method='highs')
    
    return -res.fun  # Return the negative of the maximum profit
```
The final code incorporates the insights provided by the experts, including the correct representation of the constraint related to planting at most twice the amount of tomatoes to that of potatoes. This code will accurately solve the optimization problem and provide the maximum profit the farmer can achieve by planting the optimal number of hectares of tomatoes and potatoes.
