This code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Expert, Parameter Extractor, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, and Code Reviewer. It formulates the problem with the variables, constraints, and objective function defined appropriately. The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to solve the linear programming problem and maximize the profit. The function `prob_19` takes the initial values of thin jars and stubby jars as input and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved.
