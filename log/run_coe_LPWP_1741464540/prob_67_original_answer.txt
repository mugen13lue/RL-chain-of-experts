This code defines the `prob_67` function that takes the number of gas grills and electric grills as input and returns the optimal number of each grill to be bought to minimize the total number of grills in the store while meeting the given constraints. The function uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem based on the objective function, constraints, and bounds provided by the experts.
