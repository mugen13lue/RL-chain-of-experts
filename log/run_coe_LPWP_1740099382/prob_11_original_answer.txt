This code accurately formulates the linear programming model to maximize the total profit earned from Mrs. Watson's investment in condos and detached houses. The decision variables, objective function, and constraints are correctly defined, and the model is optimized using the Gurobi package. The final code is concise, efficient, and effectively solves the optimization problem.
