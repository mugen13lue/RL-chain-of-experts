The final code provided above incorporates the insights and suggestions from various experts in the field of Operations Research. It defines a function `prob_40` that uses the Gurobi optimization library to solve the optimization problem of maximizing profit from growing potatoes and cucumbers. The function takes the number of acres of potatoes and cucumbers as input arguments, sets up the decision variables, objective function, and constraints, and then optimizes the model to find the maximum profit. This code is well-structured, efficient, and ready to be used for solving the specified problem.
