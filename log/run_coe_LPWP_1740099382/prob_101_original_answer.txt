This code effectively implements the optimization problem to minimize sugar intake while meeting the dietary requirements and constraints specified in the problem description. The `prob_101` function takes the number of alpha and omega brand drinks as input and returns the minimized sugar intake as the objective value. The code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem efficiently.
