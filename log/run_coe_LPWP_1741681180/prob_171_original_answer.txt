This code utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem efficiently. The objective function is to minimize the total amount of gas consumed, and the constraints are based on the problem requirements. The function returns the minimum amount of gas consumed to deliver the specified number of mail pieces.
