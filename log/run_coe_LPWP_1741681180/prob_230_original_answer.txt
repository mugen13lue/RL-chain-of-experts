```
This code utilizes the PuLP library in Python to solve the optimization problem efficiently. It sets up the objective function to minimize the total time for the medication to be effective and defines the constraints based on the problem requirements. The LP problem is solved to obtain the optimal values for the number of calcium and vitamin D pills that minimize the total time.
