```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_55(windrower, hay_harvester):
    c = [-10, -8]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize (-10x - 8y)
    A = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [5, 3]]  # Coefficients of the constraints
    b = [200, 300, 800]  # Right-hand side of the constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))

    return res.fun * -1  # Return the negative of the minimized objective function value
```
This code utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem with the given constraints. The objective is to maximize the amount of hay processed, and the constraints are based on the total acres of land, total fuel available, and total methane gas produced. The function returns the maximum amount of hay processed based on the optimal allocation of acres to the windrower and hay harvester.
