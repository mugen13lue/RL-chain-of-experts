```python

    """
    Args:
        anxiety_medication: an integer (number of units of anxiety medication)
        anti_depressants: an integer (number of units of anti-depressants)
    Returns:
        total_time_effective_medication: an integer (total time it takes for the medication to be effective)
    """
    total_time_effective_medication = anxiety_medication * 3 + anti_depressants * 5
    
    # Check if constraints are met
    if anxiety_medication < 30 or anxiety_medication > 2 * anti_depressants or anxiety_medication + anti_depressants < 100:
        return 1e9
    
    return total_time_effective_medication
```
This code incorporates the insights provided by the experts, including the objective function to minimize the total time it takes for the medication to be effective, the constraints related to the number of units of medication to be taken, and the logic to calculate the total time based on the units of anxiety medication and anti-depressants.
