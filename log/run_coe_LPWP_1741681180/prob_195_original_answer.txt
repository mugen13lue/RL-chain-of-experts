This code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem and find the maximum number of letters that can be sent using the given constraints. The objective function is to maximize the total number of letters, and the constraints include the number of treats available, the limit on the percentage of owls, and the minimum number of carrier pigeons required.
