This final code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, Programming Expert, Modeling Expert, and Code Reviewer. It uses the `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the optimization problem, defines the objective function, inequality constraint, initial guess, bounds, and returns the total number of hours required to deliver 1500 units of goods using camel caravans and desert trucks. The code is well-structured, clear, and optimized for minimizing the total hours effectively.
