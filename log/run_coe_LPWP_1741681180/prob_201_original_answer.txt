This code utilizes the Gurobi optimization package to solve the linear programming problem of maximizing profit for an appliance company selling refrigerators and stoves. The decision variables, objective function, constraints, and non-negativity constraints are all correctly defined within the function. The final code is well-structured and ready to be used for solving the problem.
