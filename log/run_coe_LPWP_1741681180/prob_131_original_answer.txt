The final code incorporates the insights provided by the experts, including using more descriptive variable names, defining constants for magic numbers, adding comments for clarity, aligning with the extracted variables and constraints, and ensuring consistency with the provided terminology. This code aims to minimize the gorilla's sugar intake while meeting the specified constraints related to calories, potassium, and fruit preferences.
