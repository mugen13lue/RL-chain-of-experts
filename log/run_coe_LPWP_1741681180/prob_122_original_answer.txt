```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_122(cheap_box, expensive_box, constraint1, constraint2, constraint3):
    c = [-8, -10]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize (-8x - 10y)
    A = [[3, 5], [5, 8], [2, 3]]  # Coefficients of the constraints
    b = [constraint1[2], constraint2[2], constraint3[2]]  # Right-hand side of the constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))

    return int(-res.fun)  # Return the maximum amount of foam produced
```

This code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to maximize the amount of foam produced, and the constraints are the available units of metal, acid, and the maximum heat that can be given off. The function returns the maximum amount of foam produced by the optimal combination of cheap and expensive boxes.
