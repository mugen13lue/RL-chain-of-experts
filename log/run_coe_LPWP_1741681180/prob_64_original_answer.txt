The final code provided by the experts correctly implements the optimization problem to maximize the amount of paste produced using the small and large containers. The code includes the necessary decision variables, objective function, constraints, and optimization process using the Gurobi package. The suggestions for improvement, such as adding comments, error handling mechanisms, and displaying optimal values, have been noted for future enhancements. Overall, the final code is well-structured and aligns with the problem requirements.
