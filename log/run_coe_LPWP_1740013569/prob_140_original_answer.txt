This code defines a function `prob_140` that takes the number of minutes for Beam 1 and Beam 2 as input, formulates the optimization problem using Gurobi, and returns the minimized total radiation received by the pancreas. The variables x and y represent the minutes of Beam 1 and Beam 2 used, respectively, with constraints on the dose delivered to the pancreas and tumor. The objective is to minimize the total radiation received by the pancreas.
