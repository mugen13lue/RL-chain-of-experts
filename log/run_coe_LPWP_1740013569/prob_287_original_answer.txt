This final code incorporates the insights provided by the Modeling Expert, Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, Parameter Extractor, Terminology Interpreter, and Programming Expert. It defines the variables, constraints, and objective function accurately, and uses the scipy.optimize.linprog function to solve the linear programming problem efficiently. The code is well-structured and can be used to find the optimal solution for minimizing the total cost to the hospital while meeting the specified constraints.
