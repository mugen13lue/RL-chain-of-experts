```python
def prob_117(burgers, pizza):
    """
    Args:
        burgers: an integer, the number of burgers
        pizza: an integer, the number of pizza slices
    Returns:
        obj: an integer, the objective value (cholesterol intake)
    """
    obj = 12 * burgers + 10 * pizza  # Objective function to minimize cholesterol intake

    # Solve the optimization problem
    from scipy.optimize import linprog
    c = [12, 10]  # Coefficients of the objective function
    A = [[-10, -8], [-300, -250], [12, 10]]  # Coefficients of the constraints
    b = [-130, -3000, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints
    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))

    obj = res.fun  # Optimal value of the objective function
    return obj
```
The final code provided above incorporates the insights and suggestions from various experts. It defines the objective function to minimize cholesterol intake based on the given constraints and variables. The code utilizes the linprog function from the scipy.optimize package to solve the optimization problem.
