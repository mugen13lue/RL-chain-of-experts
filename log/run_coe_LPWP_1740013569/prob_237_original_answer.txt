This code effectively models the optimization problem described in the problem statement and incorporates the insights and recommendations provided by the various experts. It correctly defines the decision variables, objective function, constraints, and optimization process using the Gurobi Optimization library. The code is well-structured, documented, and optimized to find the total number of concerts that minimizes the objective function.
