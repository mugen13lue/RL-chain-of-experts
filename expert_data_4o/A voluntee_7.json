{"comment": "Based on the provided code and comments, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The code uses the Gurobi optimization library to model and solve the voter transportation problem, which is a suitable approach for optimization problems.\n2. The decision variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent the number of vans and cars, respectively, which align with the problem requirements.\n3. The objective function is correctly set to minimize the total number of cars used, which is the goal of the problem.\n4. The constraints are defined to ensure that at least 200 voters are transported and that at most 30% of the vehicles can be vans, which are essential conditions for the problem.\n5. The code includes a function `prob_198` that takes the number of vans and cars as input and returns the total number of cars used, which provides a clear interface for solving the problem.\n6. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `prob_198` function with specific values for vans and cars and print the result, which is helpful for testing and understanding the code.\n\nOverall, the code structure and implementation seem appropriate for solving the voter transportation problem efficiently. However, it would be beneficial to include more detailed comments within the code to explain the purpose of each section and improve readability for future maintenance. Additionally, considering edge cases or scenarios where the constraints may not be feasible could enhance the robustness of the solution.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
