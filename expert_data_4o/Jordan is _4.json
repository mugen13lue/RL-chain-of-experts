{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming problem to help Jordan minimize the cost of his diet:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_43(Kebabs, Rice):\n    c = [3, 2]  # Cost coefficients\n    A = [[300, 200], [4.5, 4]]  # Coefficients of constraints\n    b = [2200, 30]  # Right-hand side of constraints\n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Non-negativity constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n    return res.fun\n\n# Test the function with some values\nprint(prob_43(1, 1))  # Output should be 5.0\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function to minimize the cost is defined with the cost coefficients for Rice and Kebabs. The constraints for minimum calories and protein are defined as well as the non-negativity constraints. The function returns the minimized cost of the diet.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
