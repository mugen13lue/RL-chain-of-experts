{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleague, it seems like the approach to solving the optimization problem is well-defined. The constraints and objective function have been properly set up for the linear programming problem.\n\nTo find the optimal values of x and y that maximize profit, you can use a linear programming solver or apply graphical methods to solve the system of inequalities. Make sure to check the feasibility of the solution by verifying that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial to conduct sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in the constraints or profit margins may impact the optimal solution. This can help in making informed decisions regarding production planning and resource allocation.\n\nOverall, the code review process should focus on ensuring that the implementation of the optimization problem aligns with the defined approach and accurately calculates the optimal values for maximizing profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
