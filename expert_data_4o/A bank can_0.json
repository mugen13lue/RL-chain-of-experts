{"comment": "Branch size optimization:The process of determining the optimal number of small and large branches to build in order to minimize the total number of branches needed while meeting customer demand.\nConstraint:A limitation or restriction that must be satisfied in order to find a feasible solution to the problem. In this case, the constraint is that the bank must be able to serve at least 1200 customers per day.\nLinear programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. In this problem, linear programming can be used to optimize the number of small and large branches to build.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
