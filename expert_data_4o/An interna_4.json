{"comment": "Overall, the code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert is well-structured and effectively solves the optimization problem of minimizing fuel consumption during goods transportation. The function `prob_151` correctly calculates the total amount of fuel consumed based on the number of ship trips and plane trips while considering the constraints provided.\n\nOne suggestion for improvement would be to add more detailed comments within the function to explain the logic behind the calculations and the reasoning for the constraints imposed. This would make the code more understandable for other developers who may need to work on it in the future.\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial to include more test cases to cover a wider range of scenarios and ensure that the function handles all possible inputs correctly. This would further validate the correctness and robustness of the code.\n\nOverall, with these minor enhancements in documentation and test coverage, the code can be considered even more reliable and ready for practical use in solving optimization problems related to goods transportation.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
