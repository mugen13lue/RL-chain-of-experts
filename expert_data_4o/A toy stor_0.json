{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up a linear programming model. Let's define the decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of trips made by the new company\n- Let y be the number of trips made by the old company\n\nNow, we can set up the objective function to minimize the total amount of diesel used:\nMinimize Z = 30x + 40y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n1. The total number of gifts delivered must be at least 1000:\n50x + 70y >= 1000\n2. There can be at most 15 trips made by the new company:\nx <= 15\n3. At least 40% of all trips must be made by the old company:\ny >= 0.4(x + y)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming model to find the optimal number of trips each company should make to minimize the total amount of diesel used.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
