{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, typically minimizing or maximizing a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible solutions in an optimization problem. In this case, constraints include the availability of goat and chicken meat, the requirement for at least 25% of bowls to be chicken curry, and the popularity requirement for goat curry.\nObjective Function:A function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is to minimize the total amount of curry base used while satisfying the given constraints.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
