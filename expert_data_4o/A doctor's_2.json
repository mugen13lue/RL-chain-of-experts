Both x and y are non-negative integers.\",\n    \"CONSTRAINTS\": \"1. x \\geq 2y: At least twice as many patients should have their temperature checked by the electronic thermometer than the regular thermometer. 2. y \\geq 50: At least 50 patients should have their temperature checked by a regular thermometer. 3. 3x + 2y \\leq 15000: Total time taken by both thermometers should not exceed the total time the office is open.\",\n    \"OBJECTIVE\": \"Maximize x + y: Maximize the number of patients whose temperature can be taken.\"\n}", "expert": "Modeling Expert"}
