{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, the company's profit, subject to certain constraints.\nConstraint:A limitation or restriction that must be satisfied in order to solve the optimization problem. In this case, the constraints include the maximum number of printers each team can produce per day and the maximum capacity of the paper tray installing machine.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the company's profit, which is determined by the number of color and black and white printers produced.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
