{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate the following constraints and objective function for this optimization problem:\n\nLet x be the number of small trucks and y be the number of large trucks.\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2x + 4y <= 30 (total number of people available)\n2. x >= 10 (at least 10 small trucks)\n3. y >= 3 (at least 3 large trucks)\n4. x = 2y (number of small trucks must be twice as much as the number of large trucks)\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize 30x + 50y (total amount of snow that can be transported)\n\nNow, we can solve this optimization problem using linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the total amount of snow that can be transported.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
