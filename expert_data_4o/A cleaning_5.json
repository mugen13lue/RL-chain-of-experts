{"comment": "Based on the feedback and suggestions provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider for improving the code:\n\n1. **Unused Arguments**: The `radio_ads` and `social_media_ads` arguments in the `prob_13` function are not utilized within the function. Consider either removing these arguments if they are not necessary or incorporating them into the optimization process.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to address scenarios where the budget is insufficient to afford any ads or when there is no feasible solution within the given constraints. This will make the code more robust.\n\n3. **Loop Adjustments**: Adjust the upper limit of the inner loop to ensure that the budget constraint is not violated. This will help in optimizing the search space for the optimal solution.\n\n4. **Detailed Comments**: Add more detailed comments within the nested loops to explain the logic behind the calculations at each step. This will enhance the readability and understanding of the code.\n\n5. **Modeling with Gurobi**: Consider using optimization modeling tools like Gurobi to formulate the problem as a mathematical model. This approach can provide a more structured and efficient way to solve optimization problems.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, you can enhance the clarity, robustness, and efficiency of the code for solving the advertising exposure optimization problem effectively.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
