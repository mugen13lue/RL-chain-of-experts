{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\nLet x be the number of cash-based machines\nLet y be the number of card-only machines\n\nWe need to minimize the total number of machines, which is x + y, subject to the following constraints:\n1. The total number of people processed per hour must be at least 500:\n20x + 30y \u2265 500\n2. The total number of rolls of paper used per hour must be at most 90:\n4x + 5y \u2264 90\n3. The number of card-only machines must not exceed the number of cash-based machines:\ny \u2264 x\n\nNow, we can solve this system of inequalities to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total number of machines.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
