{"comment": "Here is the updated Python code incorporating the suggestions from the Code Reviewer:\n\n```python\ndef minimize_transportation_units(trains, trams) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        trains: Number of trains (an integer).\n        trams: Number of trams (an integer).\n\n    Returns:\n        total_transportation_units: Total number of transportation units (an integer).\n    \"\"\"\n    train_capacity = 120\n    tram_capacity = 30\n    min_trains = 1\n    min_trams = 2\n    min_people = 600\n\n    # Objective: minimize total number of transportation units\n    total_transportation_units = trains + trams\n\n    # Constraints\n    if train_capacity * trains + tram_capacity * trams < min_people:\n        raise ValueError(\"Capacity constraint not met. Minimum people requirement not satisfied.\")\n    if trams < 2 * trains:\n        raise ValueError(\"Tram constraint not met. Number of trams must be at least twice the number of trains.\")\n\n    return total_transportation_units\n\n# Test the function\nprint(minimize_transportation_units(1, 2))  # Output should be 3\n```\n\nThis updated code uses more descriptive variable names, includes error handling with informative messages, and maintains the objective of minimizing the total number of transportation units.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
