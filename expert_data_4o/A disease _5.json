{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the optimization problem using linear programming techniques:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_224():\n    c = [-1, -1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize (-T - B)\n    A = [[5, -1], [2, 10]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [0, 22000]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(45, None))  # Solving the linear programming problem\n\n    temperature_check = res.x[0]  # Number of temperature checks\n    blood_test = res.x[1]  # Number of blood tests\n\n    return temperature_check, blood_test\n\ntemperature_check, blood_test = prob_224()\nprint(f\"Number of temperature checks: {temperature_check}\")\nprint(f\"Number of blood tests: {blood_test}\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to maximize the number of patients seen, and the constraints ensure that the number of temperature checks is at least 5 times the number of blood tests, the total staff time used does not exceed the total staff minutes available, and at least 45 blood tests are conducted.\n\nThe code then prints out the optimal number of temperature checks and blood tests to maximize the number of patients seen within the given constraints.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
