{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Parameter Extractor, we can formulate the optimization problem as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- \\( x \\): number of doses of medicine A to be made\n- \\( y \\): number of doses of medicine B to be made\n\nObjective function to maximize:\n\\( 12x + 8y \\)\n\nConstraints:\n1. \\( 30x + 40y \\leq 300 \\) (imported material constraint)\n2. \\( 50x + 30y \\leq 400 \\) (mRNA constraint)\n3. \\( x \\leq 5 \\) (maximum doses of medicine A constraint)\n4. \\( y > x \\) (number of doses of medicine B must be larger than the number of doses of medicine A)\n\nBy solving this linear programming problem, we can determine the optimal values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that maximize the number of people that can be treated. It is important to ensure that the code implementing this optimization problem is efficient, error-free, and follows best practices to obtain accurate results.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
