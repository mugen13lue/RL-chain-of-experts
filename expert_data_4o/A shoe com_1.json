{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Modeling Expert, we can formulate the optimization problem as follows:\n\n- Let x be the number of vans used and y be the number of trucks used.\n- The constraints are:\n  1. Minimum pairs of shoes constraint: 50x + 100y \u2265 2000\n  2. Number of trucks constraint: y \u2264 x\n  3. Non-negativity constraint for vans: x \u2265 0\n  4. Non-negativity constraint for trucks: y \u2265 0\n\n- The objective is to minimize the number of vans used: Minimize x\n\nTo find the minimum number of vans that can be used, we need to solve this optimization problem. By analyzing the constraints, we can see that the number of trucks used cannot exceed the number of vans used. This means that the minimum number of vans used will be when y = x.\n\nSubstitute y = x into the minimum pairs of shoes constraint: 50x + 100x \u2265 2000\nSimplify the equation: 150x \u2265 2000\nDivide by 150: x \u2265 2000/150\nx \u2265 13.33\n\nSince the number of vans used must be a whole number, the minimum number of vans that can be used is 14.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
