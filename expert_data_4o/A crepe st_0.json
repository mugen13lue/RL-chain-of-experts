{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\nLet x be the number of chocolate crepes made\nLet y be the number of peanut butter crepes made\n\nWe can then set up the following constraints based on the problem statement:\n3x + 4y <= 400 (constraint for chocolate spread)\n6x + 7y <= 450 (constraint for peanut butter spread)\nx >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for chocolate crepes)\ny >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for peanut butter crepes)\ny > x (more peanut butter crepes made than chocolate crepes)\nx >= 0.25(x+y) (at least 25% of crepes made should be chocolate)\n\nOur objective function is to minimize the total amount of crepe mix needed:\nMinimize Z = 6x + 7y\n\nBy solving this linear programming problem using the above constraints and objective function, we can determine the optimal number of chocolate and peanut butter crepes to make in order to minimize the total amount of crepe mix needed.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
