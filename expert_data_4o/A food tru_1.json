{"comment": "As a parameter extraction expert, I have extracted the following variables, constraints, and objective from the problem statement:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let x be the number of mangos sold\n- Let y be the number of guavas sold\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Budget Constraint: $5x + $3y \\leq $20000\n- Minimum Mango Sales: x \\geq 100\n- Maximum Mango Sales: x \\leq 150\n- Guava Sales Limit: y \\leq \\frac{1}{3}x\n\n**Objective:**\n- Maximize profit: Maximize $3x + $4y\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective will be used to formulate a solvable LP or MIP model for maximizing profit in this scenario.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
