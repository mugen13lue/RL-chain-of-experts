{"comment": "Based on the problem statement provided, this is an optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the total amount of grain in weight while subject to certain constraints. \n\nThe constraints in this problem are:\n1. The total energy available for transportation is 110 units.\n2. There must be twice as many large bags as tiny bags.\n3. There must be at least 20 tiny bags of rice.\n\nTo formulate this as an optimization problem, we can define the objective function as the total weight of grain that can be transported using a certain number of large and tiny bags. Let's denote the number of large bags as L and the number of tiny bags as T. \n\nThe objective function to be maximized is:\nTotal weight of grain = 25L + 6T\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n1. 4L + 1.5T <= 110 (total energy constraint)\n2. L = 2T (twice as many large bags as tiny bags)\n3. T >= 20 (at least 20 tiny bags)\n\nBy solving this optimization problem, we can determine the optimal values of L and T that maximize the total weight of grain that can be transported.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
