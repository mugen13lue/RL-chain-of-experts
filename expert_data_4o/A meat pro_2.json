{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, profit, subject to constraints.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the feasible solutions in an optimization problem. In this case, the constraint is the maximum number of hours each machine can run per year.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the profit made from producing batches of hams and pork ribs.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
