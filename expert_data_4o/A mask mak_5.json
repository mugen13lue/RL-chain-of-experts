{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I would like to add that it is important to test the code implementation thoroughly to ensure that it correctly solves the optimization problem and adheres to the constraints and objective function defined. Additionally, documenting the code and providing clear explanations for each step taken in the optimization process can help in understanding and maintaining the solution in the future. By following best practices and conducting rigorous testing, we can ensure that the code effectively minimizes the total number of boxes needed to distribute the masks while meeting all requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
