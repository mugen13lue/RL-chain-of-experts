{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (in this case, the number of each type of jar to make) that maximizes the objective function (profit) while satisfying the given constraints (available shaping and baking time).\nObjective Function:In this context, the objective function is the profit that the artisan can make by selling the thin and stubby jars. The goal is to maximize this profit.\nConstraints:These are the limitations or restrictions that the artisan must adhere to when deciding how many thin and stubby jars to make. In this case, the constraints are the available shaping and baking time per week.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
