{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, in this case, minimizing the total number of stamping machines while meeting certain constraints.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this case, the constraints are related to the minimum number of letters stamped per minute and the maximum amount of glue used per minute.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model. In this problem, linear programming can be used to optimize the number of each stamping machine to purchase.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
