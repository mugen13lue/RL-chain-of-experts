{"comment": "Variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of small wagons used.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of large wagons used.\n\nConstants:\n- Small wagon capacity: 20 units\n- Large wagon capacity: 50 units\n- Total ore needed to be taken to the surface: 2000 units\n- Minimum number of large wagons required: 10\n\nConstraints:\n1. The total number of units of ore taken to the surface:\n\\[ 20x + 50y = 2000 \\]\n2. The number of small wagons must be at least twice as much as the number of large wagons:\n\\[ x \\geq 2y \\]\n3. At least 10 large wagons must be used:\n\\[ y \\geq 10 \\]\n\nObjective:\nMinimize the total number of wagons needed:\n\\[ \\text{Minimize } x + y \\]", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
