{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider for the code review:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `crab_cakes` and `lobster_roll` in the function `prob_111` should be renamed to `x` and `y` respectively to align with the modeling knowledge and parameter extraction.\n\n2. **Constraint Adjustment**: The constraints related to the percentage of lobster rolls should be modified to `x + y <= 0.4 * (x + y)` as suggested by the modeling knowledge supplement expert.\n\n3. **Constraint Handling**: The constraints for the percentage of lobster rolls should be handled correctly in the code to ensure that at most 40% of meals are lobster rolls.\n\n4. **Objective Function**: The objective function to minimize unsaturated fat intake (`4x + 6y`) aligns with the modeling knowledge and should be kept as is.\n\n5. **Integer Variables**: If the variables `x` and `y` are expected to be integers based on the modeling expert's comment, this should be explicitly mentioned and handled in the code.\n\n6. **Optimization Solver**: The code uses `linprog` from `scipy.optimize` for linear programming. Ensure that the solver is appropriate for the problem and that the constraints and objective function are correctly defined.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions and ensuring alignment with the modeling knowledge and parameter extraction, you can enhance the code for solving the sailor's meal optimization problem effectively.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
