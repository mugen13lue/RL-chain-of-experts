{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, the code provided for solving the optimization problem looks well-structured and follows the linear programming approach to maximize profit. Here are some points to consider for code review:\n\n1. Variable Naming: The variables `c`, `A`, and `b` are appropriately named to represent the coefficients of the objective function and constraints. This enhances code readability and understanding.\n\n2. Function Structure: The `prob_5()` function encapsulates the logic for solving the optimization problem, which promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n3. Output Presentation: The code effectively displays the maximum profit and the amounts to invest in healthcare and telecom in a clear and concise manner.\n\n4. Error Handling: It would be beneficial to include error handling mechanisms in case the linear programming solver encounters any issues during the optimization process.\n\n5. Code Efficiency: The code efficiently utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem, which is a good practice for optimization tasks.\n\nOverall, the code aligns well with the problem statement and the provided modeling approach. It effectively addresses the constraints and objective function to determine the optimal investment amounts. Great job on implementing the solution!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
