{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up a linear programming model. Let's define the decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of elephants to be made\n- Let y be the number of tigers to be made\n\nThe objective function we want to maximize is the total profit, which can be expressed as:\nProfit = 5x + 4y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n- 50x + 40y <= 5000 (constraint on wood)\n- 20x + 30y <= 4000 (constraint on plastic)\n- x, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using any optimization tool or software to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
