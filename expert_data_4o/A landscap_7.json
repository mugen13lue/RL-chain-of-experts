{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (in this case, the allocation of square feet to each machine) that minimizes or maximizes a certain objective (in this case, the time required to cut the grass).\nConstraint:A restriction or limitation that must be satisfied in the problem. In this case, constraints include the availability of fuel and the limit on pollution production.\nObjective Function:A function that needs to be optimized (minimized or maximized) in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the total time required to cut the grass using both machines.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
