{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\nLet x be the number of standard keyboards and y be the number of mechanical keyboards.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x >= 30 (at least 30 standard keyboards)\n2. 2x + 5y <= 1000 (total units of plastic constraint)\n3. x + 2y <= 250 (total units of solder constraint)\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize z = x + y (total number of keyboards)\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations using linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the total number of keyboards produced.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
