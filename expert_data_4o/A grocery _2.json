{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, the net profit, by choosing the best combination of quantities for the banana-haters package and combo package.\nConstraint:In this context, constraints refer to the limitations on the quantities of apples, bananas, and grapes available in the stock that must be considered when determining the quantities of each package to prepare.\nLinear Programming:This problem can be formulated as a linear programming model, where the objective is to maximize the profit while satisfying the constraints related to the available stock quantities and the composition of the packages.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
