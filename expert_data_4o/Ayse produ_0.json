{"comment": "To determine the minimum cost of Ayse's compound, we can set up a linear programming problem. Let's define:\n- Let x be the amount of fertilizer C in kg\n- Let y be the amount of fertilizer Y in kg\n\nThe objective function to minimize the cost can be defined as:\nCost = 2x + 3y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n1. 1.5x + 5y >= 5 (at least 5 units of nitrous oxide)\n2. 3x + y >= 8 (at least 8 units of vitamin mix)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the minimum cost of Ayse's compound.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
