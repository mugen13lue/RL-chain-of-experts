{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- glass_jars: number of glass jars filled\n- plastic_jars: number of plastic jars filled\n- glass_jar_capacity: capacity of a glass jar in ml (250 ml)\n- plastic_jar_capacity: capacity of a plastic jar in ml (300 ml)\n- glass_jar_constraint: constraint specifying that at least twice as many plastic jars must be filled as glass jars\n- minimum_glass_jar_count: minimum number of glass jars to be filled (20 glass jars)\n- total_honey_capacity: total capacity of honey in ml (20000 ml)\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- objective_value: maximum number of bottles filled\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n1. The total capacity of honey filled in glass and plastic jars should not exceed the total honey capacity:\n   - g * glass_jar_capacity + p * plastic_jar_capacity \\leq total_honey_capacity\n\n2. At least twice as many plastic jars must be filled as glass jars:\n   - p \\geq 2 * g\n\n3. At least 20 glass jars should be filled:\n   - g \\geq minimum_glass_jar_count\n\nThese extracted variables, objective, and constraints can be used to formulate a solvable LP or MIP model for the given problem.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
