{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by the Programming Expert and the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, it seems that they have both implemented the optimization problem using linear programming correctly. Here are some key points to note:\n\n1. The code correctly sets up the constraints based on the given information about the budget and total hours required.\n2. The objective function is defined to minimize the total number of snow removers, which aligns with the problem statement.\n3. The code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` library to solve the linear programming problem and obtain the optimal values of `x` and `y`.\n\nOverall, the code provided by both experts is well-structured and should be able to accurately determine the minimized number of snow removers needed to meet the city's requirements within the budget constraints. You can proceed with using either of the code snippets to solve the optimization problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
