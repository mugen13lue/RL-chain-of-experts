{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues and the terminology interpreter, the optimization problem has been correctly modeled with the following components:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of personal licenses produced.\n- Let y be the number of commercial licenses produced.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production Limit: x + y \u2264 300\n2. Cost Constraint: 550x + 2000y \u2264 400000\n3. Non-negativity: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\n- Maximize 450x + 1200y\n\nThe Python function `prob_221` provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert effectively solves this optimization problem using the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize`. The function takes the number of personal and commercial licenses as input and returns the maximum profit.\n\nYou can test the function with initial values to ensure its correctness. Feel free to reach out if you need further clarification or assistance in implementing the code.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
