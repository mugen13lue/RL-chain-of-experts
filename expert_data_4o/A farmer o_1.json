{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by the Modeling Expert, the variables, constraints, and objective function for this optimization problem are as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of ferry trips\n- Let y be the number of light rail trips\n\nConstraints:\n- x \u2265 0\n- y \u2265 0\n- 20x + 15y \u2265 500 (since the farmer wants to send at least 500 boxes of corn)\n- y \u2265 4x (since the number of light rail trips has to be at least 4 times the number of ferry trips)\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize Z = x + y\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints while minimizing the objective function Z. By solving this linear programming problem, we can determine the optimal number of ferry and light rail trips needed to send at least 500 boxes of corn with the minimum total number of trips.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
