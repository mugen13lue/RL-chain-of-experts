The code defines decision variables for the number of small and large suitcases, sets up the objective function to maximize the total number of snacks, and adds constraints based on the problem requirements. Finally, it optimizes the model to find the optimal solution and returns the maximum number of snacks that can be delivered.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
