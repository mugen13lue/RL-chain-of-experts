{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves maximizing a certain objective function (in this case, tips received) subject to constraints (such as available shifts, energy units, and minimum order requirements).\nConstraint:Constraints are conditions that must be satisfied in an optimization problem. In this case, constraints include the number of available shifts, energy units, and minimum order requirements.\nObjective function:The objective function is the quantity that we want to maximize or minimize in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective is to maximize the tips received by scheduling shifts on bikes and scooters.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
