{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, typically to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, constraints include the minimum number of letters to be stamped per minute and the maximum amount of glue that can be used per minute.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. In this case, the problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to find the optimal number of each stamping machine to purchase.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
