{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have reviewed the provided code for the problem of minimizing the total amount of fuel consumed when transporting goods using ships and planes. Here are my findings and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert is well-structured and follows best practices in terms of defining a function, providing clear documentation, and conducting tests to verify the function's correctness.\n\n2. The function `prob_151` correctly calculates the total amount of fuel consumed based on the number of ship trips and plane trips, considering the constraints related to the number of containers to transport, the maximum number of plane trips allowed, and the minimum percentage of trips made by ship.\n\n3. The function returns `float('inf')` when the constraints are violated, which is a good way to handle such cases and indicate that the input is invalid.\n\n4. The test cases provided in the code are useful for verifying the function's behavior under different scenarios.\n\n5. One potential improvement could be to add more detailed comments within the function to explain the logic behind the calculations and the reasoning for the constraints imposed.\n\n6. It would also be beneficial to include additional test cases to cover a wider range of scenarios and ensure the function handles all possible inputs correctly.\n\nOverall, the code is well-written and effectively solves the optimization problem of minimizing fuel consumption during goods transportation. With some minor enhancements in documentation and test coverage, the code can be considered robust and reliable for practical use.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
