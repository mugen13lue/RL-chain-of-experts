{"comment": "Variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of small crates used.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of large crates used.\n\nConstants:\n- Small crate capacity: 20 bananas\n- Large crate capacity: 50 bananas\n- Total number of available bananas: 500\n- Minimum number of small crates: 5\n\nConstraints:\n1. The total number of bananas used in small crates: \\( 20x \\leq 500 \\)\n2. The total number of bananas used in large crates: \\( 50y \\leq 500 \\)\n3. The number of large crates must be at least twice the number of small crates: \\( y \\geq 2x \\)\n4. At least 5 small crates should be used: \\( x \\geq 5 \\)\n\nObjective:\nMaximize the total number of crates produced: \\( \\text{Maximize} \\ z = x + y \\)", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
