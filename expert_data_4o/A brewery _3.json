It also checks the constraints related to water, tea, the ratio of wine to kombucha, and the percentage of kombucha products. The function returns the objective value if all constraints are met, otherwise, it returns a large value. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function with sample input values.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
