{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, it seems that the problem statement is well-defined in terms of variables, constants, objective function, and constraints. The objective is to minimize the total time taken to transport all locals by determining the optimal number of trips made by kayak and motorboat.\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, you can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal solution that minimizes the total time needed. By formulating the problem with the given variables, constants, objective function, and constraints, you can set up the linear programming model and use optimization solvers to find the optimal values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nMake sure to review the code implementation carefully to ensure that it correctly translates the problem statement into a mathematical model and accurately calculates the optimal solution. Check for any errors, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement in the code to ensure that it adheres to best practices and delivers optimal results.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
