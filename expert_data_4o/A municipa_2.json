{"comment": "Based on the information provided and the comments from your colleagues, we can formulate the optimization problem as follows:\n\n**Variables:**\nLet x be the number of full-time staff hired and y be the number of part-time staff hired.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Total hours constraint: 40x + 15y \u2265 1000 (Total number of staff hours required)\n- Budget constraint: 1280x + 450y \u2264 31500 (Budget constraint)\n- Non-negativity constraint: x, y \u2265 0 (Number of staff hired cannot be negative)\n\n**Objective:**\nMinimize the total number of staff hired: Minimize x + y\n\nBy solving this optimization problem, the municipality can determine the optimal number of full-time and part-time staff to hire in order to meet the labor demand for mail delivery while minimizing the total number of staff hired.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
