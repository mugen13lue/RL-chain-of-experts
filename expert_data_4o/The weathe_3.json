{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the Fish Transportation Problem using linear programming techniques:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_182():\n    c = [40, 30]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize total time\n    A = [[30, 20], [-1, 0], [0, -1], [-0.6, -0.6]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [300, -5, 0, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))\n\n    return res.fun\n\n# Call the function to get the total time needed\ntotal_time = prob_182()\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to minimize the total time needed, subject to the given constraints. The optimal total time needed to transport the fish is calculated and returned by the function.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
