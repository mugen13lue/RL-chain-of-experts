{"comment": "As a Code Reviewer, I would like to provide additional insights on how to approach solving this optimization problem based on the information provided by the Terminology Interpreter and the Modeling Expert.\n\n1. Objective Function:\nThe objective function in this case is to minimize the total number of boxes used, which can be represented as:\nZ = x + y\n\n2. Constraints:\nBased on the problem requirements and the constraints defined by the Modeling Expert, we have the following constraints:\n- x \u2265 3y (There must be at least three times as many small boxes as large boxes).\n- y \u2265 5 (At least 5 large boxes must be used).\n- 25x + 45y \u2265 750 (The total number of masks distributed must be at least 750).\n\n3. Integer Variables:\nBoth x and y are non-negative integers, as the number of boxes cannot be negative and must be whole numbers.\n\n4. Solving the Optimization Problem:\nTo solve this optimization problem, we can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total number of boxes used while satisfying all constraints. By formulating the objective function and constraints as described above, we can use optimization solvers or algorithms to determine the optimal solution.\n\nBy following these steps and considering the insights provided by the Terminology Interpreter and the Modeling Expert, we can effectively approach and solve the mask distribution optimization problem to minimize the total number of boxes needed.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
