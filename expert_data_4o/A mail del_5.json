{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize or maximize a certain objective function, in this case, the total amount of gas consumed.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, the constraint is that at least 50% of the trips must be made by speed boats.\nObjective Function:A function that needs to be optimized or minimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the total amount of gas consumed.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
