{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as a linear programming problem to maximize profit. Let's define the decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of refrigerators to sell\n- Let y be the number of stoves to sell\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\nProfit = 400x + 260y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n60x + 45y <= 20000 (mover time constraint)\n20x + 25y <= 13000 (setup time constraint)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using any optimization technique such as the simplex method or graphical method to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
