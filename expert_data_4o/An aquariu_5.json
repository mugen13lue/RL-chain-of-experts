{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- otters: number of otters performing in the show\n- dolphins: number of dolphins performing in the show\n- total_tricks: total number of tricks that can be performed\n- total_treats: total number of treats available for the animals\n- max_otters: maximum number of otters allowed based on the constraint\n- i: number of otters in a specific combination\n- j: number of dolphins in a specific combination\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n1. At least 10 dolphins must be used: dolphins \\geq 10\n2. At most 30% of the performers can be otters: i \\leq 0.3 * (otters + dolphins)\n3. The total number of treats used for otters and dolphins must not exceed the total treats available: (i * 3 + j * 5) \\leq total_treats\n\nExtracted Objective:\nMaximize the total number of tricks that can be performed.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
