{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as a linear programming problem to maximize the total caloric intake while meeting the constraints on fibre and iron intake.\n\nLet:\n- x = number of cups of spinach\n- y = number of cups of soybeans\n\nObjective function to maximize total caloric intake:\nMaximize: 30x + 100y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n- Fibre constraint: 100x + 80y >= 12000\n- Iron constraint: 5x + 12y >= 300\n- Spinach cups must exceed soybean cups: x > y\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using optimization techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the total caloric intake while meeting the given constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
