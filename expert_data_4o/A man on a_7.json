{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the optimization problem can be solved using linear programming techniques. Here is a summary of the key components:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of bottles of alpha brand drink\n- Let y be the number of bottles of omega brand drink\n\nConstraints:\n1. Protein constraint: 30x + 20y >= 100 (at least 100 grams of protein)\n2. Calorie constraint: 350x + 300y >= 2000 (at least 2000 calories)\n3. Omega brand constraint: y <= 0.35(x + y) (at most 35% of the drink should be omega brand)\n\nObjective Function:\nMinimize 20x + 15y (sugar intake)\n\nTo implement this in Python, you can use the provided code snippet that utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module. This function will solve the linear programming problem and return the minimized sugar intake value based on the constraints and objective function provided.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the solution, feel free to ask!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
