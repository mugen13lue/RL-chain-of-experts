{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n1. W: Number of wraps to produce\n2. P: Number of platters to produce\n\nDefinitions:\n- W, P: Both are integers representing the quantities of wraps and platters to be produced, respectively.\n\nConstraints:\n1. 5W + 7P \u2265 3000 (meat constraint)\n2. 3W + 5P \u2265 2500 (rice constraint)\n3. W \u2265 3P (at least 3 times as many wraps as platters)\n\nObjective:\nMinimize total production time: 10W + 8P", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
