{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\nLet x be the number of light grilled cheese sandwiches\nLet y be the number of heavy grilled cheese sandwiches\n\nThe constraints are:\n2x + 3y <= 300 (total slices of bread)\n3x + 5y <= 500 (total slices of cheese)\ny >= 3x (at least 3 times as many heavy sandwiches as light sandwiches)\n\nThe objective function is:\nMinimize 10x + 15y (total production time)\n\nNow, we can use linear programming techniques to solve this problem and find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total production time.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
