{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\nLet x be the proportion of land allocated to heap leaching technique\nLet y be the proportion of land allocated to vat leaching technique\n\nThe objective function to maximize the daily production of rare earth oxide is:\nMaximize Z = 3x + 5y (tons of rare earth oxide per square mile per day)\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n1. Total land available: x + y = 100\n2. Total extraction machines available: 10x + 20y <= 100\n3. Total polluted wastewater constraint: 8x + 17y <= 90\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or any other optimization technique to find the optimal proportions of land allocated to each mining technique in order to maximize the daily production of rare earth oxide.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
