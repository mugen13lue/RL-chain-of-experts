{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by the Parameter Extractor, Code Reviewer, and Terminology Interpreter, it is clear that the fitness guru's goal is to minimize his sodium intake while meeting his calorie and protein requirements through an optimization problem. The fitness guru tracks his macronutrients, specifically focusing on sodium intake, to achieve his dietary goals.\n\nThe optimization problem involves determining the optimal combination of salmon and eggs to eat, considering the calorie constraint, protein constraint, limit on the percentage of meals that can be eggs, and non-negativity constraint. By minimizing his sodium intake while meeting his calorie and protein requirements, the fitness guru can make informed dietary choices to support his fitness goals.\n\nOverall, the fitness guru's approach of macro-counting and optimizing his nutrient intake demonstrates a strategic and disciplined approach to achieving his dietary and fitness objectives.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
