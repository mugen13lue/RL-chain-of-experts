{"comment": "Code Reviewer: Based on the comments provided by the Parameter Extractor and Modeling Expert, we have a clear understanding of the variables, constraints, and objective of the optimization problem. The problem is well-defined, and the constraints ensure that the solution is feasible within the given parameters. By using linear programming techniques, we can find the optimal values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to maximize the number of patients whose temperature can be taken while adhering to the constraints. This approach will help in efficiently allocating patients to each type of thermometer to achieve the best outcome within the specified time frame.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
