{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of trips made by the new company\n- y: number of trips made by the old company\n\nDefinitions:\n- x, y are decision variables representing the number of trips made by the new and old company, respectively.\n\n- new_one: number of gifts delivered per trip by the new company (50 gifts)\n- old_one: number of gifts delivered per trip by the old company (70 gifts)\n- new_one_: liters of diesel used per trip by the new company (30 liters)\n- old_one_: liters of diesel used per trip by the old company (40 liters)\n\n- Z: objective function to minimize the total amount of diesel used (Z = 30x + 40y)\n\nConstraints:\n1. Total number of gifts delivered must be at least 1000: 50x + 70y \\geq 1000\n2. At most 15 trips made by the new company: x \\leq 15\n3. At least 40% of all trips must be made by the old company: y \\geq 0.4(x + y)", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
