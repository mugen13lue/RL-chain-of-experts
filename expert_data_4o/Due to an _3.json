{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize the total time needed to transport all the locals.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible solutions in this problem, such as the maximum number of motorboat trips and the requirement that at least 75% of trips should be by kayak.\nObjective function:The function that needs to be minimized in this problem, which is the total time needed to transport all the locals using a combination of kayaks and motorboats.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
