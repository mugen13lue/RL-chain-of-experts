{"comment": "The Python code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert correctly implements the linear programming approach to solve the optimization problem. It defines the objective function coefficients, inequality constraints, variable bounds, and then uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to find the optimal values of acres of potatoes and cucumbers to maximize profit.\n\nThe code also correctly extracts and prints out the optimal values and the maximum profit that Mark can achieve. It follows best practices in linear programming and provides a clear and efficient solution to the problem.\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to obtain the optimal solution for the number of acres of potatoes and cucumbers Mark should grow to maximize his profit and the maximum profit he can achieve.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
