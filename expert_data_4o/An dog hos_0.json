{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\nLet x be the number of small bones to be made\nLet y be the number of large bones to be made\n\nThe objective function to minimize the amount of meat needed is:\nMinimize Z = 12x + 15y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n10x + 15y <= 2000 (total units of tooth medication)\nx >= 0 (non-negative constraint for small bones)\ny >= 30 (at least 30 large bones)\nx + y >= 0.5(x + y) (at least 50% of bones made must be small)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using a solver tool or by graphing the constraints and finding the feasible region. The optimal solution will give us the number of small and large bones to be made to minimize the amount of meat needed.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
