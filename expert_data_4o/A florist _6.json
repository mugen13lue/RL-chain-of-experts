{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the provided code, it seems that the code is correctly formulated to solve the optimization problem of maximizing the total number of flowers that reach the stores. The objective function is defined as the sum of 5 times the number of small bouquets and 10 times the number of large bouquets, which aligns with the problem requirements.\n\nThe constraints specified in the code also match the constraints mentioned in the problem statement. These constraints ensure that the florist does not exceed the maximum number of small and large bouquets that can be transported, meets the total bouquet limit, transports at least 20 large bouquets, and transports at least twice as many small bouquets as large bouquets.\n\nThe code utilizes the Gurobi optimization library to create the model, define decision variables, set the objective function, add constraints, optimize the model, and retrieve the optimal objective value. The function `prob_160` takes the number of small and large bouquets as input and returns the optimal number of flowers that can be transported to maximize the total number of flowers reaching the stores.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and correctly implements the optimization problem described in the problem statement. It follows best practices for optimization problems and delivers optimal results.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
