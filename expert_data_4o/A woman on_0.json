{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\nLet x be the number of smoothies consumed\nLet y be the number of protein bars consumed\n\nBased on the given information, we can set up the following constraints:\n2x + 7y <= 2000 (total calorie constraint)\n2x <= 7y (protein bar consumption constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the protein intake, which is given by the objective function:\nZ = 2x + 7y\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or any other optimization technique to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the protein intake while staying within the calorie constraint.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
