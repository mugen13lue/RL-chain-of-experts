{"comment": "Based on the code provided by the Programming Expert, it seems that the implementation of the optimization problem is correct. The code defines the variables, sets the objective function to maximize the total amount of snow that can be transported, adds the constraints based on the problem statement, and then optimizes the model to find the optimal solution.\n\nThe code follows the constraints and objective function outlined by the Modeling Expert and Parameter Extractor, ensuring that the optimization problem is solved correctly. The function `prob_194` takes the number of small trucks and large trucks as input and returns the maximum amount of snow that can be transported.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. It effectively utilizes the Gurobi optimization library to solve the linear programming problem and find the optimal values for the number of small and large trucks.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
