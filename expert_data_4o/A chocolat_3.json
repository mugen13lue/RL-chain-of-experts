{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, here is a summary of the problem and the solution approach:\n\nProblem:\nA chocolate company needs to transport at least 1500 boxes of chocolate using their vans and trucks. Vans can transport 50 boxes per trip at a cost of $30 per trip, while trucks can transport 80 boxes per trip at a cost of $50 per trip. The company has a budget of $1000 and the number of van trips must be more than the number of truck trips. The goal is to minimize the total number of trips.\n\nSolution Approach:\n1. Define the variables:\n   - Let x be the number of trips by vans.\n   - Let y be the number of trips by trucks.\n\n2. Formulate the constraints:\n   - Transportation constraint: 50x + 80y >= 1500\n   - Budget constraint: 30x + 50y <= 1000\n   - Non-negativity constraint: x, y >= 0\n   - Van trips must be more than truck trips: x >= y\n\n3. Additional constraint:\n   - Integer constraint: x, y are integers\n\n4. Formulate the objective function:\n   - Minimize the total number of trips: Minimize x + y\n\n5. Utilize the provided Python function `prob_149` using the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem and find the optimal solution.\n\nBy following the above approach and using the provided function, you can determine the optimal number of trips by vans and trucks to minimize the total number of trips while meeting all the constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
