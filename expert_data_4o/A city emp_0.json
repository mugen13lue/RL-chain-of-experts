{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.\n\nLet x be the number of seasonal snow removers hired and y be the number of permanent snow removers hired.\n\nThe total cost of hiring x seasonal snow removers and y permanent snow removers should not exceed the budget of $6500:\n120x + 250y \u2264 6500\n\nThe total number of hours worked by x seasonal snow removers and y permanent snow removers should be equal to 300 hours:\n6x + 10y = 300\n\nTo minimize the total number of snow removers, we can set up the objective function as:\nMinimize Z = x + y\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations to find the optimal values of x and y.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
