{"comment": "Linear Programming (LP):A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a business problem, typically involving maximizing or minimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\nConstraints:Restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in the optimization problem, such as the available floor space, the minimum percentage of laptops, and the budget constraint in this case.\nObjective function:The function that needs to be optimized, in this case, the profit earned by selling phones and laptops, which is maximized by determining the optimal quantities of phones and laptops to stock.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
