{"comment": "From the parameter extractor's comments, we can see that the objective of the fitness guru is to minimize his sodium intake, which is calculated as \\( S_{salmon} \\cdot x + S_{eggs} \\cdot y \\). This means that the fitness guru wants to find the optimal combination of salmon and eggs to meet his calorie and protein requirements while minimizing his sodium intake.\n\nThe constraints provided in the comments include the calorie constraint, the protein constraint, the limit on the percentage of meals that can be eggs, and the non-negativity constraint. These constraints ensure that the fitness guru consumes enough calories and protein while adhering to his preference for salmon and eggs and ensuring that the number of bowls of salmon and eggs are non-negative.\n\nBy following these constraints and the objective function, the fitness guru can determine the optimal number of bowls of salmon and eggs to eat in order to minimize his sodium intake while meeting his calorie and protein requirements. This optimization problem can be solved using mathematical optimization techniques such as linear programming.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
