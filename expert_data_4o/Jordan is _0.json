{"comment": "Linear Programming Problem Formulation:\n\nLet x be the number of servings of Rice and y be the number of servings of Kebab.\n\nObjective function:\nMinimize Cost = 3x + 2y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n1. Calories constraint: 300x + 200y \u2265 2200\n2. Protein constraint: 4.5x + 4y \u2265 30\n\nNon-negativity constraints:\nx \u2265 0\ny \u2265 0\n\nThis linear programming problem will help Jordan minimize the cost of his diet while meeting his daily calorie and protein requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
