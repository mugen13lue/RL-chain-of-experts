{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, this is a classic optimization problem that can be solved using linear programming techniques. \n\nLet's define the decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of bags of regular brand dog food\n- Let y be the number of bags of premium brand dog food\n\nThe objective function to minimize the cost can be defined as:\nCost = 20x + 35y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n- 4x + 12y >= 15 (calcium constraint)\n- 7x + 10y >= 20 (vitamin mix constraint)\n- 10x + 16y >= 20 (protein constraint)\n\nAdditionally, x and y should be non-negative integers.\n\nBy solving this linear programming problem, we can determine the optimal number of bags of each brand that Lucy should mix in order to minimize cost while meeting the health and taste requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
