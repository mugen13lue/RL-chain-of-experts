{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, the constraint is that at least 50% of the trips must be made by speed boats.\nObjective Function:A function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is to minimize the total amount of gas consumed while delivering 1000 pieces of mail.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
