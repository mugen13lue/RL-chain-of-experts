{"comment": "Variables:\n- \\( x \\): number of small buses to be hired.\n- \\( y \\): number of large buses to be hired.\n\nParameters:\n- \\( S = 20 \\): Capacity of a small bus in terms of number of students it can carry.\n- \\( L = 50 \\): Capacity of a large bus in terms of number of students it can carry.\n- \\( T = 500 \\): Total number of students that need transportation.\n- \\( M = 0.2 \\): Maximum percentage of buses that can be large buses.\n\nConstraints:\n1. The total number of students that need transportation must be met:\n\\[ 20x + 50y \\geq 500 \\]\n2. The number of large buses cannot exceed 20% of the total number of buses:\n\\[ y \\leq 0.2(x + y) \\]\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize the total number of buses:\n\\[ \\text{Minimize } x + y \\]", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
