{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I would like to add that it is important to also consider the efficiency of the code implementation when solving the optimization problem. It is crucial to ensure that the code is structured in a way that efficiently solves the linear programming model and finds the optimal solution in a timely manner. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include comments in the code to explain the purpose of each section and how it relates to the optimization problem. This will help improve the readability and maintainability of the code for future reference.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
