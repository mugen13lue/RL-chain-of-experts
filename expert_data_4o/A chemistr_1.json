{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, this is an optimization problem where we need to maximize the total amount of green gas produced while considering the constraints given (limited amounts of red and blue liquid, and a maximum limit on smelly gas production).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up a linear programming model. Let's define the decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of experiments of type 1 (experiment 1)\n- Let y be the number of experiments of type 2 (experiment 2)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total amount of green gas produced:\nZ = 5x + 6y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n- 3x + 5y <= 80 (red liquid constraint)\n- 4x + 3y <= 70 (blue liquid constraint)\n- x + 2y <= 10 (smelly gas constraint)\n- x, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can use a linear programming solver to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the total amount of green gas produced while satisfying all the constraints. This will help determine how many experiments of each type should be done to achieve the maximum outcome.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
