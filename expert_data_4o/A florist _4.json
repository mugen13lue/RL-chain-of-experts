{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n1. Small_bouquets: number of small bouquets to be transported\n2. Large_bouquets: number of large bouquets to be transported\n\nDefinitions:\n- Small_bouquets and Large_bouquets are decision variables representing the number of small and large bouquets the florist should transport, respectively.\n\n3. Total_flowers: total number of flowers that reach the stores\n\nDefinitions:\n- Total_flowers is the objective function that needs to be maximized, calculated as 5 times the number of small bouquets plus 10 times the number of large bouquets.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Small_bouquets \\leq 80\n2. Large_bouquets \\leq 50\n3. Small_bouquets + Large_bouquets \\leq 70\n4. Large_bouquets \\geq 20\n5. Small_bouquets \\geq 2 * Large_bouquets\n\nThese constraints ensure that the florist does not exceed the maximum number of small and large bouquets that can be transported, meets the total bouquet limit, transports at least 20 large bouquets, and transports at least twice as many small bouquets as large bouquets.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
