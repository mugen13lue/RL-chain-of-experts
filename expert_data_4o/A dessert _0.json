{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate the following optimization problem:\n\nLet x be the number of orders of matcha ice cream and y be the number of orders of orange sorbet.\n\nObjective function: Minimize the total amount of flavouring needed, which is 2x + 4y.\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2x + 4y <= 600 (constraint on ice cream)\n2. 4x + 3y <= 550 (constraint on water)\n3. x >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n4. y >= 0.15(x + y) (at least 15% of desserts made must be matcha ice cream)\n\nNow, we can solve this optimization problem using linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total amount of flavouring needed.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
