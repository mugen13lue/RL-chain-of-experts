{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of the objective function\nc = [1, 1]\n\n# Coefficients of the inequality constraints\nA = [[20, 50], [-1, 2], [0, -1]]\nb = [2000, 0, -10]\n\n# Bounds for variables\nx_bounds = (0, None)\ny_bounds = (10, None)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method='highs')\n\ntotal_wagons = res.x[0] + res.x[1]\nprint(\"Total number of wagons needed:\", total_wagons)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to minimize the total number of wagons needed, subject to the constraints defined by the problem. The code then prints out the total number of wagons needed to transport 2000 units of ore to the surface while satisfying the given conditions.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
