{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we need to minimize the total number of scooters used while ensuring that at least 300 visitors can be transported. \n\nTo solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following constraints:\n1. Let x be the number of scooters used and y be the number of rickshaws used.\n2. The total number of visitors transported should be at least 300: 2x + 3y >= 300\n3. At most 40% of the vehicles used can be rickshaws: y <= 0.4(x + y)\n\nTo minimize the total number of scooters used, we can set up the objective function:\nMinimize: x\n\nNow, we can solve this optimization problem using linear programming techniques to find the optimal solution that meets all the constraints and minimizes the total number of scooters used.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
