{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Terminology Interpreter and Modeling Expert, we can see that this problem is an optimization problem where we need to minimize the total number of grills in the store while meeting the constraints. \n\nLet's interpret the constraints and objective function based on the given information:\n\n- Constraints:\n    - Non-negativity constraint: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0 (since the number of grills cannot be negative)\n    - Minimum number of patties constraint: 20x + 30y \u2265 150 (the total number of patties cooked per minute should be at least 150)\n    - Maximum units of cooking oil constraint: 20x + 25y \u2264 140 (the total units of cooking oil used per minute should be at most 140)\n    - Relationship between gas and electric grills constraint: y \u2264 x (the number of electric grills must be less than the number of gas grills)\n\n- Objective function:\n    - Minimize Z = x + y (minimize the total number of grills in the store)\n\nNow, we can proceed with solving this optimization problem by using the constraints and objective function provided.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
