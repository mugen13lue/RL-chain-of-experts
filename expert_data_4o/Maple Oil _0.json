{"comment": "Based on the information provided, this problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to maximize the net revenue. Let's define the decision variables as follows:\n- Let x1 be the number of tanks of light oil to process\n- Let x2 be the number of tanks of non-sticky oil to process\n- Let x3 be the number of tanks of heavy oil to process\n\nThe objective function to maximize the net revenue can be formulated as:\nMaximize Z = 550x1 + 750x2 + 950x3\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n3x1 + 6x2 + 9x3 <= 250 (constraint for compound A)\n3x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 <= 150 (constraint for compound B)\nx1, x2, x3 >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nYou can use a linear programming solver like PuLP in Python to solve this optimization problem and determine the optimal number of tanks of each oil to process in order to maximize the net revenue.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
