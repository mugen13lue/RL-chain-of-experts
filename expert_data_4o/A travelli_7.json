{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, the optimization problem can be formulated as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of packs of ramen\n- Let y be the number of packs of fries\n\nObjective function:\nMinimize sodium intake: 75x + 100y\n\nSubject to:\n- Total calories consumed: 400x + 300y >= 3000\n- Total protein consumed: 20x + 10y >= 80\n- Constraint on ramen meals: x <= 0.3(x + y)\n\nBy solving this optimization problem using linear programming techniques, we can determine the optimal number of packs of ramen and fries that the salesman should eat to minimize his sodium intake while meeting his calorie and protein requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
