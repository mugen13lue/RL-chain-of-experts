{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of packs of peach flavored candy.\n- Let y be the number of packs of cherry flavored candy.\n\nConstraints:\n- Peach Flavoring: 3x \u2264 3000 (available peach flavoring)\n- Cherry Flavoring: 5y \u2264 4000 (available cherry flavoring)\n- Pack Ratio: x \u2265 y (peach candy packs must be more numerous)\n- Cherry Percentage: y \u2265 0.3(x+y) (at least 30% of the packs must be cherry flavored)\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize Z = 5x + 4y (total amount of special syrup used)\n\nThe Python code provided uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem based on the constraints and objective function. The function `prob_99` takes the number of peach flavored candy packs and cherry flavored candy packs as input and returns the minimal amount of special syrup used.\n\nYou can test the function with different inputs to find the optimal solution for minimizing the total amount of special syrup used in making the candy packs.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
