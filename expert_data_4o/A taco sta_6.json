{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, profit, subject to certain constraints.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible values of the decision variables. In this case, the constraints are the maximum number of regular and deluxe tacos that can be sold, as well as the total number of tacos that can be made.\nDecision Variables:Unknown quantities that need to be determined in order to optimize the objective function. In this problem, x1 and x2 represent the number of regular and deluxe tacos to be made, respectively.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
