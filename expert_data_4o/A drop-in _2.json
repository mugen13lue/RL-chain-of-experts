{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- \\( ear \\): number of ear tests to be performed\n- \\( blood \\): number of blood tests to be performed\n- \\( total\\_time \\): total operating time of the drop-in clinic (7525 minutes)\n- \\( blood\\_time \\): time taken to perform a blood test (30 minutes)\n- \\( ear\\_time \\): time taken to perform an ear test (5 minutes)\n- \\( max\\_blood\\_tests \\): maximum number of blood tests that can be performed\n- \\( max\\_ear\\_tests \\): maximum number of ear tests that can be performed\n- \\( total\\_tests \\): total number of tests that can be performed\n\nConstraints:\n1. At least 12 ear tests must be administered: \\( ear \\geq 12 \\)\n2. At least three times as many blood tests as ear tests should be performed: \\( blood \\geq 3 \\times ear \\)\n3. The total number of blood tests performed should not exceed the total operating time divided by the time taken to perform a blood test: \\( max\\_blood\\_tests \\leq total\\_time // blood\\_time \\)\n4. The total number of ear tests performed should not exceed the remaining operating time after performing the maximum number of blood tests, divided by the time taken to perform an ear test: \\( max\\_ear\\_tests \\leq (total\\_time - max\\_blood\\_tests \\times blood\\_time) // ear\\_time \\)\n\nObjective:\nMaximize the total number of tests that can be performed: \\( total\\_tests = max\\_blood\\_tests + max\\_ear\\_tests \\)", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
