{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, subject to constraints.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible solutions in an optimization problem. In this case, the constraints are the available amounts of powder, glue, and the maximum amount of mess that can be produced.\nObjective function:The function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the amount of slime produced, which we want to maximize.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
