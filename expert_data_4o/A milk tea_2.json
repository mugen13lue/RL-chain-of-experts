{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, the code seems to be well-structured and follows best practices for solving optimization problems using linear programming. Here are a few additional points to consider:\n\n1. The code uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem, which is a good choice for this type of optimization problem.\n\n2. The objective function is correctly defined to maximize profits by setting the coefficients of the profit from each type of milk tea.\n\n3. The constraints are properly defined based on the available stock of milk and honey, ensuring that the total production does not exceed the available resources.\n\n4. The code calculates the maximum profit by taking the negative of the result from `linprog` since it minimizes the objective function. This is a common practice in linear programming.\n\n5. The code includes example usage to demonstrate how to use the `prob_203` function and provides expected outputs for validation.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be well-written and effectively solves the optimization problem to maximize profits from selling black milk tea and matcha milk tea. If you have any specific concerns or areas for improvement in the code, please let me know.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
