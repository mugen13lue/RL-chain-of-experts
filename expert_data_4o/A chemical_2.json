{"comment": "Overall, the code reviewer has provided a clear and structured approach to solving the optimization problem presented in the scenario. The reviewer has correctly identified the variables, constraints, and objective function needed to formulate the problem. Additionally, the reviewer has explained how to interpret the constraints and objective function in the context of the problem.\n\nOne suggestion for improvement would be to provide a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the optimization problem using a specific method, such as linear programming or graphical method. This would help readers understand the process of finding the optimal values of x and y more clearly.\n\nOverall, the code reviewer has effectively analyzed the problem and provided a solid foundation for solving it.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
