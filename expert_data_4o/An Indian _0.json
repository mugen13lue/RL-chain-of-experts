{"comment": "Based on the constraints provided, we can set up the following optimization problem:\n\nLet x be the number of bowls of goat curry and y be the number of bowls of chicken curry.\n\nObjective function: Minimize Z = 6x + 5y (total amount of curry base used)\n\nSubject to:\n3x \u2264 1500 (goat meat constraint)\n5y \u2264 2000 (chicken meat constraint)\ny \u2265 0.25(x + y) (at least 25% of bowls must be chicken curry)\nx > y (number of goat curry bowls must be larger than chicken curry bowls)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total amount of curry base used.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
