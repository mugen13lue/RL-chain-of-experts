{"comment": "Based on the code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, here are some comments and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each section.\n\n2. The function `prob_13` takes two arguments `radio_ads` and `social_media_ads`, but these arguments are not used within the function. It seems like they are meant to be placeholders for potential future use, but currently, they serve no purpose.\n\n3. The function calculates the maximum exposure and the optimal number of radio and social media ads to achieve that exposure within the budget constraint. This is a good approach to solving the problem.\n\n4. The nested loops iterate through the possible combinations of radio and social media ads within the specified ranges. However, the upper limit of the inner loop should be adjusted to ensure that the budget constraint is not violated.\n\n5. It would be beneficial to add some error handling in case the budget is too low to afford any ads or if there is no feasible solution within the given constraints.\n\n6. Consider adding more detailed comments within the nested loops to explain the logic behind the calculations at each step.\n\nOverall, the code is effective in solving the optimization problem, but there are some areas where it can be further improved for clarity and robustness.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
