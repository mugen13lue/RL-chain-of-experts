{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the code provided for solving the optimization problem of determining the optimal investment amounts in healthcare and telecom industries to maximize profit. Here are my observations and feedback based on the comments provided by your colleagues:\n\n1. Variable Naming: The variables `c`, `A`, and `b` are appropriately named to represent the coefficients of the objective function and constraints. This enhances code readability and understanding, making it easier to follow the logic of the optimization problem.\n\n2. Function Structure: The `prob_5()` function encapsulates the logic for solving the optimization problem, which promotes code reusability and maintainability. The separation of concerns within the function is well-organized and aligns with best practices for structuring code.\n\n3. Output Presentation: The code effectively displays the maximum profit and the amounts to invest in healthcare and telecom in a clear and concise manner. This ensures that the results are easily understandable and accessible to the user.\n\n4. Error Handling: It would be beneficial to include error handling mechanisms in case the linear programming solver encounters any issues during the optimization process. Adding error handling code can improve the robustness of the solution and provide informative feedback to the user in case of errors.\n\n5. Code Efficiency: The code efficiently utilizes the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem, which is a good practice for optimization tasks. The use of built-in functions for optimization tasks helps in improving code efficiency and performance.\n\nOverall, the code aligns well with the problem statement and the provided modeling approach. It effectively addresses the constraints and objective function to determine the optimal investment amounts in healthcare and telecom industries. Great job on implementing the solution and following best practices for code structure and optimization techniques!
