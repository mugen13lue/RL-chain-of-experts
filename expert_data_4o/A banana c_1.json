{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Parameter Extractor, we can formulate the optimization problem as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of small crates used.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of large crates used.\n\nConstants:\n- Small crate capacity: 20 bananas\n- Large crate capacity: 50 bananas\n- Total number of available bananas: 500\n- Minimum number of small crates: 5\n\nConstraints:\n1. The total number of bananas used in small crates: \\( 20x \\leq 500 \\)\n2. The total number of bananas used in large crates: \\( 50y \\leq 500 \\)\n3. The number of large crates must be at least twice the number of small crates: \\( y \\geq 2x \\)\n4. At least 5 small crates should be used: \\( x \\geq 5 \\)\n\nObjective:\nMaximize the total number of crates produced: \\( \\text{Maximize} \\ z = x + y \\)\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, we can follow these steps:\n1. Use the constraints to create a feasible region in the \\( xy \\) plane.\n2. Identify the corner points of the feasible region.\n3. Evaluate the objective function at each corner point.\n4. Select the corner point that maximizes the objective function.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the optimal number of small and large crates to use in order to maximize the total number of crates produced while satisfying all the constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
