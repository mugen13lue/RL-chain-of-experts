{"comment": "Based on the feedback provided by the Code Reviewer, here are the updated suggestions for the code:\n\n1. Objective Function:\n- Modify the objective function to minimize the maximum of x1 and x2, representing the total time needed to produce the required pills.\n\n2. Constraints:\n- Update the constraints to ensure that the total number of allergy pills and fever reducing pills produced by both factories meets the minimum requirements.\n- Modify the rare_compound_constraint to consider the rare compound units required by each factory.\n\nBy incorporating these changes, the code will accurately reflect the optimization problem and provide the minimum total time needed to produce the required pills while efficiently utilizing the rare compound units.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
