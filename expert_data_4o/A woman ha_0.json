{"comment": "To help the woman determine how much money to put on each sports bet to maximize her average payout while ensuring her average chance of losing money is at most 30%, we can approach this as an optimization problem.\n\nLet's denote the amount of money she puts on the basketball tournament, horse race, and soccer game as x, y, and z respectively. The total amount of money she puts on all three bets should be equal to $100000, so we have the constraint x + y + z = 100000.\n\nThe expected payout for each bet can be calculated as follows:\n- Expected payout for basketball tournament = 1.2x\n- Expected payout for horse race = 0.5y\n- Expected payout for soccer game = 0.1z\n\nThe average chance of losing money can be calculated as follows:\n- Average chance of losing money = 0.5x + 0.25y + 0.1z\n\nThe objective is to maximize the average payout, which can be represented as the objective function:\n- Objective function = 1.2x + 0.5y + 0.1z\n\nSubject to the constraint that the average chance of losing money should be at most 30%:\n- 0.5x + 0.25y + 0.1z <= 0.3\n\nNow, we can set up this optimization problem and solve it to determine the optimal amounts to put on each sports bet to maximize the average payout while meeting the constraint on the average chance of losing money.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
