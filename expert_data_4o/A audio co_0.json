{"comment": "To optimize the profit, we can set up a linear programming problem. Let's define the variables:\n- Let x be the number of wired headphones produced per day\n- Let y be the number of wireless headphones produced per day\n\nNow, we can set up the constraints based on the given information:\n1. Wired team can make at most 100 wired headphones per day: x <= 100\n2. Wireless team can make at most 170 wireless headphones per day: y <= 170\n3. The shared audio testing machine can make a maximum of 150 headphones per day: x + y <= 150\n\nWe also need to consider that the number of headphones produced cannot be negative: x >= 0, y >= 0\n\nThe objective function we want to maximize is the total profit:\nProfit = 50x + 20y\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
