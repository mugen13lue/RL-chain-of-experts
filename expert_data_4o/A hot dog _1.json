{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as a linear programming problem to minimize the total number of butcher shops while meeting the constraint of producing at least 500 hot dogs per day with only 30 workers available.\n\nLet:\n- Let x be the number of small butcher shops to build\n- Let y be the number of large butcher shops to build\n\nObjective function:\nMinimize Z = x + y\n\nSubject to:\n30x + 70y >= 500 (at least 500 hot dogs per day)\n2x + 4y <= 30 (limited number of workers available)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total number of butcher shops while meeting the constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
