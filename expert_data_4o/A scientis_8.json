{"comment": "Based on the comments and suggestions provided by your colleagues, the code for solving the optimization problem of maximizing the scientist's total vitamin D intake by drinking orange and apple juice boxes is well-structured and optimized. The code incorporates the constraints and objective function defined by the experts, uses the Gurobi optimization library to formulate and solve the linear programming model, and provides the expected output.\n\nHere are some key points to consider based on the feedback:\n\n1. The code defines the decision variables, constraints, and objective function accurately based on the problem statement and expert recommendations.\n2. The code ensures that the constraints related to the minimum number of orange and apple juice boxes, the maximum vitamin C intake, and the preference for apple juice are properly enforced.\n3. The code utilizes the Gurobi optimization library effectively to maximize the total vitamin D intake while considering the specified constraints.\n4. The code provides a clear example of how to use the `prob_104` function with input values to obtain the expected output.\n\nOverall, the code aligns well with the modeling knowledge and suggestions provided by the experts, and it successfully addresses the optimization problem at hand. If you have any specific questions or areas you would like to further discuss or improve, feel free to let me know.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
