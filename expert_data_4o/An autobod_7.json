{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, subject to constraints.\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible solutions in an optimization problem. In this case, the constraints are the limits on the number of electric jacks and the amount of electricity and gas that can be used.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be optimized in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the total number of cars processed every hour.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
