{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible options to minimize or maximize a certain objective function, in this case, minimizing total pollution.\nConstraint:Restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this case, the constraints include the minimum number of employees to be transported and the maximum number of buses that can be used.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a set of linear relationships. This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to find the optimal number of cars and buses to minimize pollution.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
