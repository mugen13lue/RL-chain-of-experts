{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming model to solve the optimization problem:\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import LpProblem, LpVariable, lpSum, LpMinimize\n\ndef prob_227(subsoil, topsoil):\n    # Create the linear programming problem\n    prob = LpProblem(\"Minimize Water Usage\", LpMinimize)\n\n    # Define the variables\n    x = LpVariable(\"x\", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')  # Number of bags of subsoil\n    y = LpVariable(\"y\", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')  # Number of bags of topsoil\n\n    # Add the objective function\n    prob += 10*x + 6*y\n\n    # Add constraints\n    prob += 10*x + 6*y <= 150  # Water constraint\n    prob += y >= 10  # Minimum topsoil constraint\n    prob += y <= 0.3*x + 0.3*y  # Topsoil percentage constraint\n\n    # Solve the problem\n    prob.solve()\n\n    # Return the minimized amount of water required\n    return int(prob.objective.value())\n\n# Test the function with initial values\nprint(prob_227(0, 0))  # Output should be 0\n```\n\nThis code uses the PuLP library to create a linear programming problem, define variables, add the objective function and constraints, and then solve the problem to find the minimized amount of water required to hydrate the garden bed. You can test the function with different values to verify its correctness and efficiency in solving the optimization problem.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
