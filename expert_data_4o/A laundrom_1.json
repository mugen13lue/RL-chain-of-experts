{"comment": "Based on the code provided by your colleague, here are some comments and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: The variable names used in the function `prob_71` are not very descriptive. Consider using more meaningful names that reflect the purpose of each variable. For example, instead of `var1`, `var2`, `var3`, and `var4`, you could use names like `top_items_per_day`, `front_items_per_day`, `top_energy_consumption`, and `front_energy_consumption`.\n\n2. Magic Numbers: The numbers 10, 0.4, 5000, and 7000 are used directly in the code without any explanation. Consider defining these numbers as constants at the beginning of the function or as function arguments to improve readability and maintainability.\n\n3. Code Optimization: The objective variable `obj` is initialized with a very large value (1e9) at the beginning of the function. Instead of using a large value, you could initialize it with a more reasonable value based on the problem constraints to avoid unnecessary comparisons.\n\n4. Comments: While the function has a docstring explaining the purpose of the function and its arguments, consider adding comments within the code to explain the logic behind specific conditions or loops for better understanding.\n\n5. Testing: It's good that your colleague provided an example usage of the function. However, consider adding more test cases with different input values to ensure that the function works correctly under various scenarios.\n\nOverall, the code provided seems to address the optimization problem effectively. By incorporating the suggestions mentioned above, you can enhance the readability, maintainability, and robustness of the code.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
