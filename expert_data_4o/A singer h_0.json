{"comment": "constraint optimization:This problem involves optimizing a certain objective (minimizing the total number of concerts) while satisfying certain constraints (minimum audience members, maximum practice days, maximum percentage of R&B concerts).\ninteger programming:This problem can be formulated as an integer programming problem where the decision variables represent the number of pop and R&B concerts to be held, and the objective function is to minimize the total number of concerts.\nlinear programming:This problem can also be approached using linear programming techniques, where the objective function and constraints are linear in nature, and the goal is to find the optimal solution that minimizes the total number of concerts.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
