{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the optimization problem can be formulated as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of regular sandwiches to be made.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of special sandwiches to be made.\n\nParameters:\n- \\( eggs_{regular} = 2 \\)\n- \\( bacon_{regular} = 3 \\)\n- \\( eggs_{special} = 3 \\)\n- \\( bacon_{special} = 5 \\)\n- \\( eggs_{total} = 40 \\)\n- \\( bacon_{total} = 70 \\)\n- \\( profit_{regular} = 3 \\)\n- \\( profit_{special} = 4 \\)\n\nObjective:\n- Maximize profit: \\( Z = 3x + 4y \\)\n\nConstraints:\n- Eggs constraint: \\( 2x + 3y \\leq 40 \\)\n- Bacon constraint: \\( 3x + 5y \\leq 70 \\)\n- Non-negativity constraint: \\( x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0 \\)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, the provided Python code utilizes the PuLP library. It defines decision variables, sets up the objective function to maximize profit, adds constraints related to the availability of eggs and bacon, and then solves the problem to find the optimal solution.\n\nAfter running the code, it will output the optimal profit and the number of regular and special sandwiches that should be made to maximize profit. This approach ensures that the breakfast joint efficiently allocates its resources to achieve the best outcome.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
