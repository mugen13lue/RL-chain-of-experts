{"comment": "Constraint:In this context, constraints refer to the limitations or restrictions on the resources available for making art pieces, such as the limited quantities of paint, glitter, and glue.\nOptimization:Optimization involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible options. In this case, the goal is to maximize profit by determining the optimal number of large and small art pieces to make.\nLinear Programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a situation with multiple linear constraints. In this problem, linear programming can be used to optimize the production of large and small art pieces given the constraints and profit margins.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
