{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- Small Canoes (x): the number of small canoes used to transport fish.\n- Smaller Diesel Boats (y): the number of smaller diesel boats used to transport fish.\n- Total Number of Canoes and Diesel Boats: the total number of canoes and diesel boats needed to transport fish.\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n- x \\geq 3y: The number of small canoes used has to be at least 3 times as many as the number of diesel boats used.\n- 10x + 15y \\geq 1000: At least 1000 fish need to be transported to shore.\n- x \\geq 0: Non-negativity constraint for the number of small canoes.\n- y \\geq 0: Non-negativity constraint for the number of smaller diesel boats.\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize the total number of canoes and diesel boats needed: minimize x + y.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
