{"comment": "Here is the Python code implementing the linear programming model to solve the given problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_142():\n    c = [-5, -6]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize (-5x - 6y)\n    A = [[3, 5], [4, 3], [1, 2]]  # Coefficients of the left-hand side of the constraints\n    b = [80, 70, 10]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n    x_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for x (experiment 1)\n    y_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for y (experiment 2)\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method='highs')\n\n    return res.fun * -1  # Return the negative of the optimal objective value to maximize\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(prob_142())\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function to maximize is the total amount of green gas produced (5x + 6y), and the constraints are set based on the availability of red and blue liquid, as well as the limit on smelly gas production. The function returns the optimal total amount of green gas produced by running the experiments.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
