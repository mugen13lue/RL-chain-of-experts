{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as a linear programming problem to minimize the total amount of gas used while satisfying the constraints given. \n\nLet:\n- x = number of submarine trips\n- y = number of boat trips\n\nObjective function:\nMinimize Z = 30x + 25y (total amount of gas used)\n\nSubject to:\n- 100x + 80y >= 1000 (at least 1000 pieces of mail need to be transported)\n- x <= 6 (at most 6 submarine trips)\n- y >= 0.5(x+y) (minimum of 50% of trips must be by boat)\n\nBy solving this linear programming problem, we can determine the optimal number of submarine and boat trips that should be used to minimize the total amount of gas used while meeting the constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
