{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming problem to minimize the total amount of gas used while satisfying the given constraints:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_181():\n    c = [30, 25]  # Coefficients of the objective function (gas used for submarine and boat)\n    A = [[100, 80], [-1, -1], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [1000, -6, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n    bounds = [(0, 6), (0, None)]  # Bounds for the variables x and y\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n    return res.fun\n\n# Test the function\nprint(prob_181())\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function, inequality constraints, and variable bounds are defined based on the problem statement. The function returns the minimum amount of gas used to transport at least 1000 pieces of mail while meeting the given constraints.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
