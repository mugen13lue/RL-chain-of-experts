{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n1. old: Cost to operate at the old farm per day.\n2. new_farm: Cost to operate at the new farm per day.\n3. constraint1: Limit for the raspberries to be provided.\n4. constraint2: Limit for the blueberries to be provided.\n5. constraint3: Limit for the strawberries to be provided.\n6. constraint4: Weight of raspberries provided by the old farm per day.\n7. constraint5: Weight of blueberries provided by the old farm per day.\n8. constraint6: Weight of strawberries provided by the old farm per day.\n\nDefined Variables:\n- x1: Amount of raspberries harvested from the old farm.\n- x2: Amount of blueberries harvested from the old farm.\n- x3: Amount of strawberries harvested from the old farm.\n- y1: Amount of raspberries harvested from the new farm.\n- y2: Amount of blueberries harvested from the new farm.\n- y3: Amount of strawberries harvested from the new farm.\n\nObjective:\nMinimize the total cost, which is calculated as 300 times the sum of raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries harvested from the old farm, plus 200 times the sum of raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries harvested from the new farm.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raspberries constraint: x1 + y1 = constraint1\n2. Blueberries constraint: x2 + y2 = constraint2\n3. Strawberries constraint: x3 + y3 = constraint3\n4. Raspberries weight constraint: 2x1 + 4y1 >= constraint4\n5. Blueberries weight constraint: 2x2 + y2 >= constraint5\n6. Strawberries weight constraint: 4x3 + 2y3 >= constraint6\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective function form the basis for the linear programming model to optimize the berry farmer's operations while meeting the contract requirements and minimizing costs.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
