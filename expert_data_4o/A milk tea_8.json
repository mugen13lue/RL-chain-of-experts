{"comment": "Based on the feedback and comments provided by your colleagues, the code for solving the optimization problem to maximize profits from selling black milk tea and matcha milk tea appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for linear programming.\n\nHere are some key points to consider based on the feedback:\n\n1. The code correctly defines the objective function to maximize profits by setting the coefficients of the profit from each type of milk tea.\n\n2. The constraints are properly defined based on the available stock of milk and honey, ensuring that the total production does not exceed the available resources.\n\n3. The code uses the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to solve the linear programming problem, which is a suitable choice for this type of optimization problem.\n\n4. The code calculates the maximum profit by taking the negative of the result from `linprog` since it minimizes the objective function, which is a common practice in linear programming.\n\n5. Example usage is provided to demonstrate how to use the `prob_203` function and validate the expected outputs.\n\nOverall, the code is well-written and effectively solves the optimization problem. If you have any specific concerns or areas for improvement in the code, please let me know.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
