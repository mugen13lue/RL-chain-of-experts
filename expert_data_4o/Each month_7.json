{"comment": "Code Reviewer: ```The adjustments made to the code by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert are in line with the suggestions provided earlier. The optimization of the inner loop range and the use of the min function to calculate the upper limit based on the cost constraint have improved the efficiency of the code. Additionally, the code now includes more test cases to validate the function's correctness.\n\nOverall, the code has been optimized and is well-structured to solve the optimization problem effectively. The adjustments made align with best practices in optimization and linear programming. Great job on incorporating the feedback and improving the code!```", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
