{"comment": "As a Code Reviewer, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Linear Programming (LP) model and the Python code for maximizing Mrs. Watson's total profit from her investment in the real estate market. Here are my observations and feedback:\n\n1. LP Model Formulation:\n   - The LP model is well-structured with clearly defined variables, constraints, and objective function.\n   - The constraints ensure that Mrs. Watson's investment meets the specified requirements, such as the budget limit, minimum investment percentages, and minimum investment amounts.\n   - The objective function is correctly defined to maximize the total profit earned from the investment.\n\n2. Python Code Implementation:\n   - The `prob_11` function is appropriately defined with clear input parameters and return value.\n   - The coefficients of the objective function and inequality constraints are correctly set up in the `c`, `A`, and `b` matrices.\n   - The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used effectively to solve the linear programming problem and obtain the maximum profit.\n   - The calculation of the maximum profit as the negative of the minimum value obtained by `linprog` is accurate.\n\n3. Testing and Output:\n   - The test case provided in the code to calculate the maximum profit with initial investments of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The expected output of 760000.0 for the test case confirms that the function is correctly maximizing the profit based on the constraints.\n\nOverall, the LP model formulation and Python code implementation align well with the problem requirements and provide a systematic approach to optimizing Mrs. Watson's investment strategy. The code is structured, readable, and effectively utilizes the `scipy.optimize` module for solving linear programming problems. Great work on addressing Mrs. Watson's investment optimization challenge!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
