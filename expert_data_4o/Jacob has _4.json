{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, it seems like the objective is to maximize profit by determining the optimal investment amounts in Jacob's favorite clothing and tech companies. \n\nTo solve this optimization problem, you can use the provided Python code snippet that utilizes the Gurobi optimization library. The code defines decision variables for the investments in the clothing and tech companies, sets up the objective function to maximize profit, and adds constraints based on the investment limits and requirements.\n\nYou can call the `prob_8` function with the investment amounts in the clothing and tech companies as arguments to calculate the maximum profit that Jacob can achieve. The function will return the maximum profit value.\n\nMake sure to test the function with different investment amounts to verify that it provides the correct results. If there are any errors or inefficiencies in the code, you can identify and suggest improvements to ensure optimal performance.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
