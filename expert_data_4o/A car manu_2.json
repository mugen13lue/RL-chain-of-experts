{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, it is clear that the problem at hand can be solved using linear programming techniques. By defining the decision variables, objective function, and constraints as outlined, we can determine the optimal number of containers of Oil Max and Oil Max Pro to produce in order to maximize profit.\n\nIt is important to note that linear programming is a mathematical method used to optimize outcomes in a given model with linear relationships. The objective function represents the quantity to be maximized (profit in this case), while constraints are the restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied (such as the available quantities of substances A, B, and C).\n\nBy following the steps outlined by the Code Reviewer and utilizing the terminology provided by the Terminology Interpreter, we can efficiently solve the optimization problem and make informed decisions on the production of Oil Max and Oil Max Pro.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
