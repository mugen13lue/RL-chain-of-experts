{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\n- Let x be the number of limousines used\n- Let y be the number of buses used\n\nWe can then set up the following constraints based on the problem statement:\n1. The total number of people transported must be at least 400:\n12x + 18y \u2265 400\n2. At least 70% of the vehicles must be limousines:\nx \u2265 0.7(x + y)\n\nWe want to minimize the total number of vehicles used, so our objective function is:\nMinimize Z = x + y\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the constraints and objective function provided above.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
