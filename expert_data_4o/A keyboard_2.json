{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by the Code Reviewer and the Programming Expert, here are some key points to consider for the code review:\n\n1. The code sets up the optimization problem correctly by defining decision variables, setting the objective function to maximize the total number of keyboards, and adding constraints based on the available resources.\n\n2. The use of the Gurobi optimization library is appropriate for solving linear programming problems efficiently.\n\n3. The function `prob_277` takes in the number of mechanical and standard keyboards as input arguments, but it does not actually use these values in the optimization problem. Instead, it defines decision variables `x` and `y` within the function itself. It would be more appropriate to use the input arguments to set the initial values of `x` and `y`.\n\n4. The function returns the optimal objective value as an integer, which is the maximum total number of keyboards manufactured. This aligns with the objective of the optimization problem.\n\n5. It would be beneficial to add comments within the code to explain the purpose of each section, such as defining decision variables, setting the objective function, adding constraints, and optimizing the model.\n\nOverall, the code implementation is on the right track, but there are some areas for improvement in terms of parameter usage and code documentation.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
