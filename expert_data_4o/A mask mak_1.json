{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can define the following:\n\n- Optimization: Minimizing the total number of boxes needed to distribute at least 750 masks.\n- Constraints:\n  1. There must be at least three times as many small boxes as large boxes.\n  2. At least 5 large boxes must be used.\n  3. The total number of masks distributed must be at least 750.\n- Objective function: Minimize the total number of boxes used.\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\n- Let x be the number of small boxes used.\n- Let y be the number of large boxes used.\n\nWe can then formulate the objective function and constraints based on the problem requirements and solve for the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total number of boxes used while satisfying all constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
