{"comment": "Constraint:In this context, constraints refer to the limitations or restrictions on the resources available for making art pieces, such as the limited quantities of paint, glitter, and glue.\nObjective function:The objective function in this problem is to maximize profit, which is achieved by determining the optimal number of large and small art pieces to make based on the given constraints and profit margins.\nLinear programming:This problem can be formulated as a linear programming model, where the goal is to maximize a linear objective function subject to linear constraints. By using mathematical optimization techniques, the optimal solution can be found to maximize profit in this scenario.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
