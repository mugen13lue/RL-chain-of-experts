{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Terminology Interpreter and Modeling Expert, we can approach this problem using linear programming techniques.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- Let x be the number of model trains to be made.\n- Let y be the number of model planes to be made.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Wood constraint: 3x + 4y \u2264 120 (available units of wood)\n2. Paint constraint: 3x + 2y \u2264 90 (available units of paint)\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\nThe objective function is to maximize profit:\nZ = 8x + 10y\n\nBy solving this linear programming problem, we can determine the optimal number of model trains and model planes to be made in order to maximize profit while satisfying the constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
