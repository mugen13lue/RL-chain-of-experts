{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, it is evident that the problem can be effectively solved using linear programming techniques. The objective function to maximize profit and the constraints related to the available quantities of substances A, B, and C have been clearly defined.\n\nThe code provided by the Programming Expert effectively implements the linear programming model using the Gurobi library. The decision variables, objective function, and constraints are correctly set up in the code. The model is then optimized to determine the optimal number of containers of Oil Max and Oil Max Pro to produce in order to maximize profit.\n\nBy following the steps outlined in the code and utilizing the extracted variables provided by the Parameter Extractor, the car manufacturer can efficiently solve the optimization problem and make informed decisions on production quantities. The code is well-structured and aligns with the problem requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
