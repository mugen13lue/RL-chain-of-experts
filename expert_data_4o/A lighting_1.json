{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the terminology provided by the Terminology Interpreter, we can understand that the LED fixture is more energy-efficient compared to the fluorescence lamp. The LED fixture consumes 5 units of electricity per hour, while the fluorescence lamp consumes 8 units of electricity per hour. Additionally, the LED fixture needs to be changed 3 times a decade, whereas the fluorescence lamp needs to be changed 4 times a decade.\n\nTo optimize the installation of lights and reduce the total number of light changes, we need to consider the energy consumption and the number of times each type of light needs to be changed. Since the customer requires at least 300 light fixtures and can use at most 2000 units of electricity, we need to find the optimal combination of LED fixtures and fluorescence lamps that meets these requirements while minimizing the total number of light changes.\n\nGiven that at least 30% of the implemented lights must be fluorescence lamps, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of each type of light fixture to be installed. Let's denote the number of LED fixtures as L and the number of fluorescence lamps as F. \n\nThe total number of light fixtures is given by:\nL + F = 300\n\nThe total units of electricity consumed is given by:\n5L + 8F <= 2000\n\nTo minimize the total number of light changes, we need to minimize the total number of times the lights need to be changed. This can be achieved by minimizing the total number of LED changes and fluorescence lamp changes, which is given by:\n3L + 4F\n\nBy solving these equations simultaneously, we can determine the optimal number of LED fixtures and fluorescence lamps to be installed to reduce the total number of light changes while meeting the customer's requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
