{"comment": "To formulate a linear programming (LP) model for this problem, we can define the decision variables as follows:\nLet x be the number of pill A to be consumed\nLet y be the number of pill B to be consumed\n\nThe objective function to minimize the cost for the patient can be defined as:\nMinimize Z = 4x + 5y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n3x + 6y >= 40 (minimum 40 units of sleep-inducing medicine)\n5x + y >= 50 (minimum 50 units of anti-inflammatory medicine)\n\nAdditionally, the variables x and y should be non-negative:\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nThis LP model ensures that the patient consumes at least 40 units of sleep-inducing medicine and 50 units of anti-inflammatory medicine while minimizing the cost by choosing the optimal combination of pill A and pill B.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
