{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the optimization problem described:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_158():\n    c = [1, 1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize x + y\n\n    A = [[-20, -50], [0, -1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [-500, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for variables x and y\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n    return res.fun\n\n# Test the function\nprint(prob_158())\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective function is to minimize the total number of buses, subject to the constraints defined by the problem. The function returns the optimal value of the objective function, which represents the minimum total number of buses needed to transport at least 500 students while respecting the constraints.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
