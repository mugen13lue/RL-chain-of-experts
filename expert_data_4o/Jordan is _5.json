{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n1. x: Number of servings of Rice\n2. y: Number of servings of Kebab\n\nDefinitions:\n- x and y are integer variables representing the number of servings of Rice and Kebab, respectively.\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n1. Calories Constraint: 300x + 200y \\geq 2200\n2. Protein Constraint: 4.5x + 4y \\geq 30\n3. Non-negativity Constraint: x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0\n\nObjective Function:\nMinimize Cost = 3x + 2y\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective function form a solvable linear programming model that helps Jordan minimize the cost of his diet while meeting his daily calorie and protein requirements.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
