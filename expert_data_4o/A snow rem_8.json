{"comment": "Overall, the code provided by the Programming Expert seems to effectively address the optimization problem outlined by the Code Reviewer, Modeling Expert, and Parameter Extractor. The code correctly defines the variables, sets the objective function, adds the necessary constraints, and optimizes the model to find the optimal solution.\n\nThe function `prob_194` takes the number of small trucks and large trucks as input and returns the maximum amount of snow that can be transported, which aligns with the problem requirements. Additionally, the code utilizes the Gurobi optimization library, which is a suitable choice for solving linear programming problems.\n\nIn conclusion, the code appears to be well-structured and in line with the problem specifications. It successfully implements the optimization problem and provides a solution that maximizes the total amount of snow that can be transported.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
