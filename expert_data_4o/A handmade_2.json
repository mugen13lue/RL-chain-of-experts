{"comment": "Quality Assurance Engineer: ```The function prob_267 seems to be well-structured and follows the problem statement accurately. However, I would recommend adding more test cases to ensure the function handles different scenarios correctly. Additionally, it might be beneficial to include input validation to handle edge cases where negative values are passed as arguments. Overall, the function looks good, but more robust testing and input validation could enhance its reliability.```", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
