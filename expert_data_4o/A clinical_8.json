Variable Naming: It would be beneficial to use more descriptive variable names in the code to improve readability and maintainability. For example, instead of using 'x' and 'y', consider using 'hours_northern_factory' and 'hours_western_factory'.\n\n2. Input Validation: Add input validation to ensure that the input values are within the acceptable range and are of the correct data type. This will help prevent errors and improve the robustness of the function.\n\n3. Documentation: Enhance the documentation of the function by providing more detailed explanations of the parameters, return value, and the overall purpose of the function. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.\n\n4. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any potential errors that may occur during the optimization process. This will improve the reliability of the function.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, you can enhance the code quality and ensure that the optimization problem is solved efficiently and accurately.```", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
