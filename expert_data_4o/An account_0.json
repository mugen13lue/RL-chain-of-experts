{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can set up the following equations:\n\nLet x be the number of full time workers and y be the number of part time workers.\n\nTotal hours worked: 8x + 4y = 500\nTotal cost: 300x + 100y = 15000\n\nTo minimize the total number of workers, we can set up the objective function as follows:\n\nMinimize Z = x + y\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total number of workers.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
