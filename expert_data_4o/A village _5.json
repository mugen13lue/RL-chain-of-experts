{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize the total number of bikes needed for transportation.\nConstraint:The restriction that at most 40% of the vehicles can be cars is a constraint that limits the possible combinations of bikes and cars used for transportation.\nLinear programming:This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to minimize the total number of bikes used subject to the constraints on the number of people to be transported and the maximum percentage of cars allowed.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
