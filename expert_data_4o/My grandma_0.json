{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate the following linear programming (LP) model:\n\nLet:\n- Let x be the number of pills of Zodiac to be taken\n- Let y be the number of pills of Sunny to be taken\n\nObjective function:\nMinimize Cost = 1x + 3y\n\nSubject to:\n1.3x + 1.2y >= 5 (for Z1 requirement)\n1.5x + 5y >= 10 (for D3 requirement)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThis LP model ensures that the medicine requirements for Z1 and D3 are met while minimizing the cost. By solving this LP, we can determine the optimal number of pills of Zodiac and Sunny that should be taken to fulfill the requirements at the lowest cost.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
