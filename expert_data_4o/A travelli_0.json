{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate the following optimization problem:\n\nLet x be the number of packs of ramen and y be the number of packs of fries that the salesman should eat.\n\nObjective function: Minimize sodium intake (75x + 100y)\n\nSubject to:\n- Total calories consumed: 400x + 300y >= 3000\n- Total protein consumed: 20x + 10y >= 80\n- Constraint on ramen meals: x <= 0.3(x + y)\n\nNow, we can solve this optimization problem using linear programming techniques to determine the optimal number of packs of ramen and fries that the salesman should eat to minimize his sodium intake while meeting his calorie and protein requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
