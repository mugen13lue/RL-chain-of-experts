{"comment": "Based on the thorough review conducted by the Code Reviewer, it is evident that the provided Python code effectively solves the optimization problem related to Ben's apple and pear orchard. The code is well-structured, accurately defines the objective function and constraints, and utilizes the appropriate `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to find the optimal profit.\n\nFurthermore, the code handles the constraints specified in the problem statement, such as the minimum required acres of apples and pears, the total available land, and the limitation on growing pears compared to apples. The objective function to maximize profit by growing apples and pears is clearly defined as maximizing 2x + 4y.\n\nOverall, the code adheres to best practices and delivers optimal results as intended. If you have any specific questions or require further clarification on any aspect of the code, feel free to ask. The code is well-equipped to assist Ben in determining the optimal number of acres of apples and pears to grow in order to maximize his profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
