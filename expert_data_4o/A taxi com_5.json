{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, it seems like the problem has been well-analyzed and modeled using linear programming techniques. The variables, constraints, and objective function have been clearly defined, and the objective is to maximize the total earnings for the taxi company per shift.\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, you can use the extracted variables, constraints, and objective function provided by the Parameter Extractor and the Modeling Expert. You can also refer to the prob_261 function defined by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert for a structured approach to calculating the total earnings based on the given constraints.\n\nMake sure to carefully review the code implementation to ensure that it accurately reflects the problem statement and constraints. Additionally, consider testing the code with different inputs to verify its correctness and efficiency in maximizing the total earnings for the taxi company per shift.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
