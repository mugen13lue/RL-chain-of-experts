{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\nLet x be the number of trips made by cargo planes\nLet y be the number of trips made by ultrawide trucks\n\nWe need to minimize the total number of trips, which can be represented as:\nTotal trips = x + y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n1. Each cargo plane trip can transport 10 tires, so the total number of tires transported by planes is 10x\n2. Each ultrawide truck trip can transport 6 tires, so the total number of tires transported by trucks is 6y\n3. The total number of tires transported must be at least 200, so:\n10x + 6y \u2265 200\n\n4. The total cost of transportation must not exceed $22000, so:\n1000x + 700y \u2264 22000\n\n5. The number of plane trips cannot exceed the number of truck trips, so:\nx \u2264 y\n\nNow, we can set up the objective function and constraints to solve this optimization problem using linear programming techniques.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
