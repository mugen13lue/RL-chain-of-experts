{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution to the problem. In this case, the constraints include the maximum number of bus trips and the minimum percentage of car trips.\nObjective function:The function that needs to be optimized in the problem. In this case, the objective function is to minimize the total time needed to transport the chicken by determining the number of trips for each mode of transportation.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
