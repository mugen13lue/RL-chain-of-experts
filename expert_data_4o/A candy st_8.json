{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, it is clear that the problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to maximize profits. The decision variables, constraints, and objective function have been clearly defined. The objective is to maximize the profit function Z = 3x + 5y, subject to the constraints related to the quantities of regular and sour candy available.\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem and find the optimal values of x and y that maximize profits, you can use optimization techniques. By following the defined variables, constraints, and objective function, you can determine the optimal production quantities for the regular mix and sour surprise mix.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
