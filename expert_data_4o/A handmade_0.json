{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can set up the following linear programming model to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced:\n\nLet x be the number of basketballs produced and y be the number of footballs produced.\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize Z = x + y\n\nSubject to:\n5x + 3y <= 1500 (material constraint)\nx + 2y <= 750 (time constraint)\nx >= 3y (at least three times as many basketballs as footballs)\ny >= 50 (at least 50 footballs)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming model using a solver tool or by graphing the constraints to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the total number of sports equipment produced.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
