{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Modeling Expert, Code Reviewer, and Parameter Extractor, the optimization problem has been well-analyzed and formulated. The minimum number of vans that can be used is determined to be 14, considering the constraints and objective of minimizing the number of vans used. The variables, constraints, and objective have been clearly identified and utilized in solving the problem. The solution aligns with the requirements and constraints specified in the problem statement. Great job in conducting a thorough review and analysis of the optimization problem!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
