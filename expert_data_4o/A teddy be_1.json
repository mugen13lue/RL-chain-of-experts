{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I have reviewed the linear programming problem developed based on the information provided and the comments from the Modeling Expert. Here are my findings:\n\n1. VARIABLES:\n   - The variables x1 and x2 represent the number of hours factory 1 and factory 2 operate, respectively. These variables are correctly defined.\n\n2. CONSTRAINTS:\n   - The constraints for factory 1 production of black, white, and brown bears are correctly formulated as:\n     - 5x1 + 10x2 >= 20 (black bears)\n     - 6x1 + 10x2 >= 5 (white bears)\n     - 3x1 >= 15 (brown bears)\n   - These constraints ensure that the daily demand for each color of teddy bears is met.\n\n3. Non-negativity constraints:\n   - The non-negativity constraints x1, x2 >= 0 are included to ensure that the number of hours operated by each factory is non-negative.\n\n4. OBJECTIVE:\n   - The objective function to minimize the total cost: $300x1 + $600x2 is correctly defined. This objective function aligns with the teddy bear company's goal of minimizing production costs.\n\nOverall, the linear programming problem is well-structured and captures the requirements of the teddy bear company accurately. The constraints and objective function are appropriately defined to optimize the production process while meeting the daily demand for teddy bears. I recommend proceeding with this formulation for further analysis and optimization.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
