{"comment": "Overall, the LP model formulated by the Code Reviewer is correct and aligns with the problem statement. The objective function and constraints are appropriately defined to minimize the cost while meeting the medicine requirements.\n\nThe code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert is also well-structured and uses the linprog function from scipy.optimize to solve the linear programming problem. The function prob_26 takes the number of pills of Zodiac and Sunny as input and returns the optimal cost value.\n\nOne suggestion for improvement would be to add more descriptive comments within the code to explain the purpose of each step or parameter. This can enhance the readability and understanding of the code for other developers.\n\nOverall, both the LP model and the code implementation are effective in solving the optimization problem outlined in the problem statement.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
