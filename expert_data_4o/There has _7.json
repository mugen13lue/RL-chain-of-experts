{"comment": "Based on the feedback provided by your colleagues, it seems that the code you have implemented to solve the optimization problem is on the right track. Here are some additional suggestions based on the feedback:\n\n1. Variable Naming: It's good that you have used more descriptive variable names like 'helicopter_trips' and 'bus_trips'. This enhances readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n2. Comments: Adding comments within the code to explain the purpose of each constraint and the objective function is a good practice. It helps other developers understand the code logic more easily.\n\n3. Input Validation: Ensure that input parameters are validated to handle potential errors or unexpected behavior. Check if input values are within the valid range and handle edge cases appropriately.\n\nOverall, your code seems to be well-structured and aligned with the problem requirements. By incorporating these suggestions, you can further improve the clarity and robustness of the code. Keep up the good work!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
