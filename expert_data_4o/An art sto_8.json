{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n1. x1: Number of large art pieces to be made.\n2. x2: Number of small art pieces to be made.\n\nDefinitions:\n- x1, x2 are decision variables representing the quantities of large and small art pieces to be produced, respectively. \n\nConstraints:\n1. 4x1 + 2x2 <= 100: Constraint on the availability of paint.\n2. 3x1 + x2 <= 50: Constraint on the availability of glitter.\n3. 5x1 + 2x2 <= 70: Constraint on the availability of glue.\n4. x1 >= 5: Constraint to make at least 5 units of large art pieces.\n5. x2 >= 5: Constraint to make at least 5 units of small art pieces.\n\nObjective:\nMaximize 30x1 + 15x2: The objective function is to maximize the profit by determining the optimal number of large and small art pieces to produce based on the given constraints and profit margins.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
