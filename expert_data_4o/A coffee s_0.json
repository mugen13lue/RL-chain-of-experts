{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as a linear programming problem to minimize the total production time. Let's define our decision variables:\n\nLet x be the number of mochas to make\nLet y be the number of regular coffees to make\n\nOur objective function is to minimize the total production time:\nMinimize Z = 5x + 3y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n3x + 6y <= 400 (constraint for coffee powder)\n6x + 2y <= 500 (constraint for milk)\nx >= 3y (mochas must be made at least 3 times as many as regular coffees)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using any optimization tool or software to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total production time.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
