{"comment": "As a Code Reviewer, I have reviewed the Python code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert for implementing the LP model to maximize profit in this scenario. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The code correctly defines the objective function coefficients, inequality constraints coefficients, and right-hand side values based on the LP model provided.\n2. The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to solve the linear programming problem and maximize profit, which is appropriate for this scenario.\n3. The function returns the negative of the maximum profit, which is a valid approach to obtain the actual maximum profit value.\n\nHowever, there is a minor issue with the code formatting. The closing triple backticks for the Python code block are missing at the end of the code snippet. It is recommended to include the closing triple backticks to ensure proper formatting.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code snippet with the closing triple backticks included:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_37(mango_cost, guava_cost):\n    c = [-3, -4]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize profit: 3x + 4y\n\n    A = [[5, 3], [-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1/3]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [20000, -100, 150, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='highs')\n\n    return -res.fun  # Return the maximum profit\n\n# Test the function with given mango and guava costs\nprint(prob_37(5, 3))\n```\n\nOverall, the code implementation is accurate and aligns with the LP model provided. By addressing the formatting issue, the code will be more readable and maintain best practices.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
