{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the linear programming approach to solve the optimization problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_5():\n    c = [-0.01, -0.03]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize profit\n    A = [[1, 1], [-3, 1], [0, 1]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [100000, 0, 70000]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, None), (0, None)])\n    \n    profit = -res.fun  # Maximum profit\n    healthcare = res.x[0]  # Amount invested in healthcare\n    telecom = res.x[1]  # Amount invested in telecom\n\n    return profit, healthcare, telecom\n\nprofit, healthcare, telecom = prob_5()\nprint(\"Maximum Profit: $\", round(profit, 2))\nprint(\"Amount to Invest in Healthcare: $\", round(healthcare, 2))\nprint(\"Amount to Invest in Telecom: $\", round(telecom, 2))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem with the given constraints and objective function. The optimal amounts to invest in healthcare and telecom to maximize profit are then calculated and displayed.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
