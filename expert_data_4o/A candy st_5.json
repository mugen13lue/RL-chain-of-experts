{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: number of kilograms of regular mix to be produced\n- y: number of kilograms of sour surprise mix to be produced\n\nDefinitions:\n- x, y are non-negative integers representing the quantities of each type of candy mix to be produced.\n\nExtracted Constraints:\n- 0.8x + 0.1y \u2264 80 (constraint for regular candy)\n- 0.2x + 0.9y \u2264 60 (constraint for sour candy)\n- x, y \u2265 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nExtracted Objective:\n- Maximize Z = 3x + 5y\n\nThese extracted variables, constraints, and objective function form the basis for solving the linear programming problem to maximize profits in the candy store scenario.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
