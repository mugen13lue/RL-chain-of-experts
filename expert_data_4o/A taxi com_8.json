{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function (in this case, total earnings) subject to constraints (such as the number of vehicles, pollution limits, and passenger requirements).\nConstraint:A restriction that limits the possible solutions to the optimization problem. In this case, constraints include the maximum percentage of motorcycles, pollution limits, and passenger requirements.\nObjective Function:The function that needs to be optimized (maximized or minimized) in an optimization problem. In this case, the objective function is the total earnings of the taxi company per shift.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
