{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, it is clear that the problem at hand can be effectively solved using linear programming techniques to maximize the net revenue. By defining the decision variables, formulating the objective function, and setting the constraints, you can use a linear programming solver like PuLP in Python to determine the optimal number of tanks of each oil to process.\n\nIt is important to note that the net revenue represents the total revenue generated from selling the processed oil after deducting the processing costs. Compound A and Compound B are the chemical components required in specific quantities to process each type of crude oil. By maximizing the net revenue, the company can achieve the highest possible profitability by optimizing the processing of different types of crude oil based on the available resources.\n\nBy following the outlined approach and utilizing the appropriate tools, you can efficiently solve the optimization problem and make informed decisions regarding the processing of light oil, non-sticky oil, and heavy oil to maximize the company's net revenue.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
