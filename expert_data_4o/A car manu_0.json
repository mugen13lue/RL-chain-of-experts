{"comment": "Based on the given information, this problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to maximize profit. Let's define the decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of containers of Oil Max to produce\n- Let y be the number of containers of Oil Max Pro to produce\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit can be expressed as:\nMaximize 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n46x + 13y <= 1345 (constraint for substance A)\n43x + 4y <= 346 (constraint for substance B)\n56x + 45y <= 1643 (constraint for substance C)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nBy solving this linear programming problem, we can determine the optimal number of containers of Oil Max and Oil Max Pro to produce in order to maximize profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
