{"comment": "Based on the feedback provided by the Code Reviewer, Programming Expert, and Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert, here are some key points to consider for the code review:\n\n1. The code correctly sets up the optimization problem by defining decision variables, setting the objective function to maximize the total number of keyboards, and adding constraints based on the available resources.\n\n2. The use of the Gurobi optimization library is appropriate for efficiently solving linear programming problems.\n\n3. The function `prob_277` takes in the number of mechanical and standard keyboards as input arguments, but it does not actually use these values in the optimization problem. It would be more appropriate to utilize these input arguments to set the initial values of decision variables `x` and `y`.\n\n4. The function returns the optimal objective value as an integer, which aligns with the objective of the optimization problem.\n\n5. Adding comments within the code to explain the purpose of each section, such as defining decision variables, setting the objective function, adding constraints, and optimizing the model, would improve code readability and maintainability.\n\nOverall, the code implementation is on the right track, but there are some areas for improvement in terms of parameter usage and code documentation. Consider incorporating the suggestions provided to enhance the code quality and clarity.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
