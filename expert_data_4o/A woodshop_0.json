{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate the following optimization problem:\n\nLet x be the number of miter saws and y be the number of circular saws purchased.\n\nObjective function: minimize x + y (total number of saws)\n\nConstraints:\n1. 50x + 70y \u2265 1500 (cut at least 1500 planks of wood per day)\n2. 60x + 100y \u2264 2000 (produce at most 2000 units of sawdust per day)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total number of saws needed.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
