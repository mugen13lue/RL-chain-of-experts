{"comment": "After reviewing the problem statement and the comments provided by the Terminology Interpreter, Code Reviewer, and Parameter Extractor, it is clear that the goal is to determine the optimal number of LED fixtures and fluorescence lamps to be installed in order to minimize the total number of light changes while meeting the customer's requirements.\n\nTo summarize the key points:\n- LED fixtures are more energy-efficient than fluorescence lamps, consuming 5 units of electricity per hour compared to 8 units for fluorescence lamps.\n- LED fixtures need to be changed 3 times a decade, while fluorescence lamps need to be changed 4 times a decade.\n- The customer requires at least 300 light fixtures and can use at most 2000 units of electricity.\n- At least 30% of the implemented lights must be fluorescence lamps.\n\nThe problem can be approached by setting up the following equations:\n1. L + F = 300 (Total number of light fixtures required)\n2. 5L + 8F <= 2000 (Total units of electricity consumed should not exceed 2000)\n3. F >= 0.3(L) (At least 30% of the implemented lights must be fluorescence lamps)\n4. Minimize: 3L + 4F (Total number of times the lights need to be changed)\n\nBy solving these equations simultaneously, the optimal values for L (number of LED fixtures) and F (number of fluorescence lamps) can be determined to minimize the total number of light changes while meeting the customer's requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
