{"comment": "From the programming expert's perspective, the code provided seems to be well-structured and follows best practices for optimization problems using the Gurobi library. The function `prob_250` takes in the necessary parameters and sets up the optimization model to maximize the total number of units produced based on the constraints provided.\n\nHowever, there are a few points to consider in relation to the problem statement:\n\n1. The objective function in the code is set to maximize the total number of units produced, which is the sum of cans and glass bottles. In the problem statement, the objective is to maximize the total number of units produced, not just the sum of cans and glass bottles. Therefore, the objective function should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n2. The constraints in the code are based on the capacity of soda required, the ratio of cans to glass bottles, and the minimum number of glass bottles required. These constraints align with the problem statement, but it's important to ensure that they are correctly implemented and interpreted.\n\n3. The code should be tested with different input values to verify that it produces the expected results and adheres to the constraints specified in the problem statement.\n\nOverall, the code provided by the programming expert serves as a good starting point for solving the optimization problem related to soda production. By addressing the points mentioned above and potentially making adjustments to the objective function, the code can be further optimized to meet the requirements of the problem statement.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
