{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- x: Number of model trains to be made\n- y: Number of model planes to be made\n- wood_train: Units of wood required for a model train (3 units)\n- paint_train: Units of paint required for a model train (3 units)\n- wood_plane: Units of wood required for a model plane (4 units)\n- paint_plane: Units of paint required for a model plane (2 units)\n- wood_available: Available units of wood (120 units)\n- paint_available: Available units of paint (90 units)\n\nConstraints:\n1. Wood constraint: 3x + 4y \u2264 120\n2. Paint constraint: 3x + 2y \u2264 90\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n4. Integer constraint: x, y are integers\n\nObjective:\nMaximize Z = 8x + 10y\n\nThese variables, constraints, and objective function are essential for formulating a solvable linear programming model to determine the optimal number of model trains and planes to maximize profit while considering the available resources.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
