{"comment": "After reviewing the code provided by your colleagues, I have identified a potential issue in the constraints section of the code. The constraints provided in the code are not consistent with the problem statement and the constraints outlined by the Modeling Expert and Parameter Extractor.\n\nSpecifically, the constraints related to the maximum percentage of R&B concerts are incorrect. The correct constraint should be:\n```\ny <= 0.4 * (x + y)  # Maximum percentage of R&B concerts constraint\n```\n\nAdditionally, the coefficients of the inequality constraints in the code are not aligned with the problem statement. The correct coefficients should be:\n```\nA = [[-100, -240], [2, 4], [-1, -1]]\nb = [-constraint1, constraint2, -constraint3]\n```\n\nI recommend updating the code to reflect these corrections in order to accurately model the problem and constraints provided. This will ensure that the code provides the correct solution to the optimization problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
