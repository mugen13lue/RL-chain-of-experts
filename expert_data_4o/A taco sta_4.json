{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I would suggest implementing the linear programming techniques mentioned in the review to solve this optimization problem efficiently. It is important to ensure that the code accurately represents the decision variables, constraints, and objective function as outlined in the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues.\n\nI would recommend thoroughly testing the code with different scenarios to verify that it correctly calculates the optimal values of x1 and x2 that maximize profit while adhering to all constraints. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include comments in the code to explain the purpose of each section and make it easier for others to understand and maintain the code in the future.\n\nOverall, by following the guidelines provided by your colleagues and implementing the appropriate techniques, you can ensure that the code effectively solves the optimization problem and provides the desired results.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
