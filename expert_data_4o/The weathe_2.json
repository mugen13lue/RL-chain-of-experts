{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the optimization problem can be formulated as follows:\n\nVariables:\nLet x be the number of helicopter trips and y be the number of car trips.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Fish Constraint: 30x + 20y \u2265 300\n2. Helicopter Trips Constraint: x \u2264 5\n3. Car Trips Constraint: y \u2265 0.6(x+y)\n4. Non-negativity Constraint: x, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\nMinimize total time: 40x + 30y\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, you can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total time needed to transport the fish. By formulating the problem in this way, you can efficiently analyze the trade-offs between using helicopters and cars to transport the fish while meeting the specified constraints.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
