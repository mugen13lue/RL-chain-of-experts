{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the optimization problem described by the Code Reviewer:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_214(basketball_tournament, horse_race, soccer_game, limit_1, limit_2):\n    c = [-1.2, -0.5, -0.1]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize\n    A = [[1, 1, 1], [0.5, 0.25, 0.1]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [100000, 30]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_eq=A, b_eq=b, bounds=[(0, None), (0, None), (0, None)])\n\n    return -res.fun  # Return the maximum average payout\n\n# Test the function with example values\nprint(prob_214(0, 0, 0, 100000, 30))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem defined by the objective function, constraints, and bounds. The function returns the maximum average payout that the woman can achieve by placing bets on the basketball tournament, horse race, and soccer game while meeting the constraints.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
