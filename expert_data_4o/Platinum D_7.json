{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n1. x: Number of personal licenses produced.\n2. y: Number of commercial licenses produced.\n\nDefinitions:\n- x, y are integers representing the quantities of personal and commercial licenses produced, respectively. \n\nConstraints:\n1. Production Limit: x + y \u2264 300\n2. Cost Constraint: 550x + 2000y \u2264 400000\n3. Non-negativity: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\n- Maximize 450x + 1200y\n\nThe variables, constraints, and objective extracted align with the requirements of a solvable LP model.", "expert": "Parameter Extractor"}
