{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the optimization problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nVariables:\nLet x be the number of personal licenses produced and y be the number of commercial licenses produced.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production Limit: x + y \u2264 300\n2. Cost Constraint: 550x + 2000y \u2264 400000\n3. Non-negativity: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\nMaximize 450x + 1200y\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, you can use the provided Python function `prob_221` which utilizes the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` to find the maximum profit. You can test the function with initial values to verify its correctness.\n\nIf you need further assistance in understanding or implementing the code, feel free to ask for help.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
