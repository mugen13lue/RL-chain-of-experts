{"comment": "Linear Programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. It involves optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\nObjective Function:The objective function in a linear programming problem is the mathematical expression that needs to be maximized or minimized. In this case, the objective function would be the cost of the diet that Jordan wants to minimize.\nConstraints:Constraints are the restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in a linear programming problem. In this case, the constraints would be the minimum calorie and protein requirements that Jordan wants to meet in his diet.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
