{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution (in this case, the minimum cost) from a set of possible options (different quantities of milk and vegetables) while satisfying certain constraints (minimum calcium and iron requirements).\nLinear programming:A method used to find the optimal solution to a problem with linear constraints. In this case, we can use linear programming to determine the quantities of milk and vegetables the boy should consume to minimize his cost while meeting his nutritional requirements.\nObjective function:In this problem, the objective function is to minimize the cost of consuming milk and vegetables. The objective function is typically a mathematical expression that represents the quantity to be optimized (in this case, cost) in terms of decision variables (quantities of milk and vegetables).\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
