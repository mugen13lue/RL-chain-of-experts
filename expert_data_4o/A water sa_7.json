{"comment": "Overall, the problem has been well-analyzed and a clear linear programming model has been formulated to maximize the total amount of glacial water transported. The Python code provided for solving the optimization problem seems to be structured correctly and utilizes the `linprog` function effectively.\n\nTo ensure the code functions as intended, you can test it with initial values as shown in the code comments. If you encounter any issues or need further clarification on the implementation, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. Good job on breaking down the problem and providing a structured solution!", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
