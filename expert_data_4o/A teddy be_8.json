{"comment": "Linear programming:Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. It involves optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\nObjective function:The objective function in a linear programming problem is the mathematical expression that needs to be maximized or minimized. In this case, the objective function would be the cost of production that the teddy bear company wants to minimize.\nConstraints:Constraints in a linear programming problem are the limitations or restrictions that must be satisfied. In this case, the constraints would be the minimum number of each colored teddy bear that needs to be produced daily to meet children's demand.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
