{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the given problem using linear programming:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_200(hams, pork_ribs):\n    c = [-150, -300]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize (-150x - 300y)\n    A = [[4, 2], [2.5, 3.5]]  # Coefficients of the constraints\n    b = [4000, 4000]  # Right-hand side of the constraints\n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for variables x and y\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n    if res.success:\n        max_profit = -res.fun  # Maximum profit achieved\n        return max_profit\n    else:\n        return \"Optimization failed\"\n\n# Test the function with an example\nprint(prob_200(0, 0))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to maximize profit, subject to the constraints on machine hours. The function returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by producing a certain number of batches of hams and pork ribs.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
