{"comment": "Additionally, I noticed that the coefficients of the inequality constraints in the code provided by your colleagues are not aligned with the problem statement and the constraints outlined by the Modeling Expert and Parameter Extractor. \n\nThe correct coefficients for the inequality constraints should be:\n```\nA = [[-100, -240], [2, 4], [-1, -1]]\nb = [-constraint1, constraint2, -constraint3]\n```\n\nI recommend updating the code to reflect these corrections to accurately model the problem and constraints provided. This will ensure that the code provides the correct solution to the optimization problem.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
