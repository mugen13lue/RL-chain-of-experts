{"comment": "Linear Programming (LP):A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model, typically involving a set of linear relationships subject to constraints.\nObjective function:The function that needs to be optimized in a linear programming problem, representing the goal to be achieved (in this case, maximizing the number of fish transported).\nConstraints:Restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in a linear programming problem, such as the budget constraint and the requirement that the number of sled dog trips must be less than the number of truck trips in this case.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
