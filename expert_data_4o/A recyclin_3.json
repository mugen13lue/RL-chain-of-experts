{"comment": "Extracted Variables:\n- Small_bins: number of small bins\n- Large_bins: number of large bins\n- Small_workers: number of workers required for a small bin (2 workers)\n- Large_workers: number of workers required for a large bin (5 workers)\n- Small_capacity: capacity of a small bin (25 units)\n- Large_capacity: capacity of a large bin (60 units)\n- Total_workers: total number of available workers (100 workers)\n\nConstraints:\n1. Total_small_bins = 3 * Large_bins\n2. Total_large_bins = Large_bins\n3. Total_bins = Total_small_bins + Total_large_bins\n4. Total_small_bins \\geq 10\n5. Total_large_bins \\geq 4\n6.
