{"comment": "Based on the problem statement provided, we can formulate the following linear programming problem to help Bob minimize the cost of his diet:\n\nLet:\n- x = number of servings of noodles\n- y = number of servings of protein bars\n\nObjective function:\nMinimize Cost = 5x + 2.5y\n\nSubject to:\n600x + 250y >= 2000 (calories constraint)\n1.5x + 5y >= 16 (protein constraint)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThis linear programming problem will help Bob determine the optimal number of servings of noodles and protein bars to purchase in order to meet his daily calorie and protein requirements while minimizing his overall cost.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
