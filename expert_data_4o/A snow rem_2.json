{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by the Code Reviewer and Modeling Expert, it is clear that the optimization problem can be formulated using the following constraints and objective function:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the number of small trucks\n- Let y be the number of large trucks\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2x + 4y <= 30 (total number of people available)\n2. x >= 10 (at least 10 small trucks)\n3. y >= 3 (at least 3 large trucks)\n4. x = 2y (number of small trucks must be twice as much as the number of large trucks)\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize 30x + 50y (total amount of snow that can be transported)\n\nBy following these constraints and objective function, the optimization problem can be solved using linear programming techniques to determine the optimal values of x and y that maximize the total amount of snow that can be transported.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
