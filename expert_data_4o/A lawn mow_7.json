{"comment": "Optimization Problem:This problem involves maximizing or minimizing a certain objective function, in this case, the amount of lawn that can be mowed.\nConstraint:Restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in order to find a feasible solution. In this problem, constraints include the number of employees available, the minimum number of small and large teams required, and the ratio between small and large teams.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a set of linear relationships. This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to find the optimal number of small and large teams to maximize the amount of lawn mowed.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
