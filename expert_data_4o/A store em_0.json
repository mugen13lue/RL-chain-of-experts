{"comment": "Linear Programming (LP):Linear programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a given set of constraints. In this case, it will be used to minimize the wage bill while meeting the specified requirements.\nObjective function:The objective function in this context would be to minimize the total wage bill, which is the sum of the weekly earnings of senior citizens and young adults.\nConstraints:Constraints are the conditions that must be satisfied in the optimization problem. In this case, the constraints include keeping the weekly wage bill below $30000, having at least 50 workers with at least 10 young adults, and ensuring the number of young adults is at least a third of the number of senior citizens.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
