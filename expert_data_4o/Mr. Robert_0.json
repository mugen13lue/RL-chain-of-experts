{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following constraints and objective function:\n\nLet x be the amount invested in healthcare and y be the amount invested in telecom.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x + y = 100000 (total investment is $100000)\n2. y >= 3x (amount invested in telecom is at least three times the amount invested in healthcare)\n3. y <= 70000 (amount invested in telecom is at most $70000)\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize profit = 0.01x + 0.03y (profit from healthcare investments + profit from telecom investments)\n\nNow, we can solve this problem using linear programming techniques. By substituting the constraints into the objective function, we get:\n\nMaximize 0.01x + 0.03y\nSubject to:\nx + y = 100000\ny >= 3x\ny <= 70000\n\nSolving this system of equations will give us the optimal amounts to invest in healthcare and telecom to maximize profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
