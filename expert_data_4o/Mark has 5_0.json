{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can use linear programming techniques. Let's define our decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of acres of potatoes to grow\n- Let y be the number of acres of cucumbers to grow\n\nNow, we can set up the constraints based on the given information:\n1. Mark must grow at least 12 acres of potatoes: x >= 12\n2. Mark must grow at least 15 acres of cucumbers: y >= 15\n3. Mark can grow at most twice the amount of cucumbers as potatoes: y <= 2x\n4. Mark has a total of 50 acres of land available: x + y <= 50\n\nNext, we can define the objective function to maximize Mark's profit:\nProfit = 500x + 650y\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using a solver tool or by graphing the constraints and finding the feasible region. The optimal solution will give us the number of acres of potatoes and cucumbers Mark should grow to maximize his profit, as well as the maximum profit he can achieve.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
