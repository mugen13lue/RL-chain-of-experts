{"comment": "Here is the Python code that solves the optimization problem of minimizing the total number of boxes needed to distribute masks using small and large boxes:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the coefficients of the objective function\nc = [1, 1]\n\n# Define the coefficients of the inequality constraints\nA = [[-1, 3], [0, -1], [-25, -45]]\nb = [-5, -750]\n\n# Define the bounds for x and y (number of small and large boxes)\nx_bounds = (0, None)\ny_bounds = (5, None)\n\n# Solve the linear programming problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Extract the optimal values of x and y\nx_opt = res.x[0]\ny_opt = res.x[1]\n\n# Print the optimal solution\nprint(f\"Optimal number of small boxes: {int(x_opt)}\")\nprint(f\"Optimal number of large boxes: {int(y_opt)}\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem defined by the objective function, constraints, and variable bounds. The optimal values of the number of small and large boxes are then extracted and printed to the console.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
