{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, it seems like the problem can be approached as a linear programming optimization problem. The constraints and objective function have been clearly defined by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert and the Modeling Expert.\n\nTo maximize profit, your family should invest in apartments and townhouses such that the total investment does not exceed $600,000, the investment in apartments does not exceed $200,000, and the investment in apartments is at least half as much as that in townhouses.\n\nYou can use the provided constraints and objective function to formulate the optimization problem and solve it using linear programming techniques. By maximizing the objective function 0.10x + 0.15y, you can determine the optimal amounts to invest in apartments and townhouses to maximize profit.\n\nYou can refer to the code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert as a starting point to implement the optimization problem in code and test different investment scenarios to find the optimal solution.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
