{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, it is clear that the optimization problem can be solved by setting up a system of equations and constraints to minimize the cost function while meeting the iron and calcium requirements.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Let x be the number of pills of supplement A and y be the number of pills of supplement B.\n- The constraints are:\n    - 5x + 4y >= 40 (minimum iron requirement)\n    - 10x + 15y >= 50 (minimum calcium requirement)\n- The objective is to minimize the total cost C = 2x + 3y.\n\nYou can use a linear programming solver or graphically solve the system of equations to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost while meeting the iron and calcium requirements. By following this approach, you can determine how many pills of each supplement the man should buy to minimize costs.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
