{"comment": "\nParameter Extractor: ```It's great to see that the code provided by the Programming Expert aligns well with the optimization problem defined earlier. The variables x and y are correctly identified as the number of goat curry bowls and chicken curry bowls, respectively. The objective function to minimize the total amount of curry base used is accurately represented as 6*x + 5*y. The constraints related to goat and chicken meat availability, chicken curry percentage, and popularity requirements are appropriately extracted and implemented in the code. Overall, the code structure reflects a clear understanding of the problem requirements and objectives.```", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
