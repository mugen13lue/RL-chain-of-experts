{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the requirements and costs of the supplements.\n\nLet x be the number of pills of supplement A and y be the number of pills of supplement B.\n\nThe total cost C can be represented as:\nC = 2x + 3y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n5x + 4y >= 40 (minimum iron requirement)\n10x + 15y >= 50 (minimum calcium requirement)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost function C.\n\nNow, we can use a linear programming solver or graphically solve the system of equations to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost while meeting the iron and calcium requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
