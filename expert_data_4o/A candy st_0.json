{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as a linear programming problem to maximize profits. Let's define our decision variables:\n- Let x be the number of kilograms of regular mix to be produced\n- Let y be the number of kilograms of sour surprise mix to be produced\n\nNow, we can set up the objective function to maximize profits:\nMaximize Z = 3x + 5y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n0.8x + 0.1y <= 80 (constraint for regular candy)\n0.2x + 0.9y <= 60 (constraint for sour candy)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using optimization techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize profits.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
