The objective function is to minimize the negative profit, and the constraints are based on the budget and the maximum number of handbags that can be sold. The function returns the maximum monthly profit that can be achieved by selling a certain number of regular and premium handbags.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
