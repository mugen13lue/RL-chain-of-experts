{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the Linear Programming (LP) model for maximizing Mrs. Watson's total profit from her investment can be formulated as follows:\n\nVariables:\nLet x be the amount invested in condos and y be the amount invested in detached houses.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x + y \u2264 760000 (total budget constraint)\n2. 0.2x \u2264 x (minimum 20% investment in condos)\n3. y \u2265 20000 (minimum investment of $20000 in detached houses)\n4. x \u2265 0 (non-negativity constraint for condos)\n5. y \u2265 0 (non-negativity constraint for detached houses)\n\nObjective:\nMaximize 0.5x + y (total profit earned from the investment)\n\nThis LP model ensures that Mrs. Watson's investment adheres to the specified constraints and aims to maximize her total profit. By solving this optimization problem, you can provide Mrs. Watson with the best investment strategy to achieve her financial goals in the real estate market.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
