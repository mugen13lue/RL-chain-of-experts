{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Terminology Interpreter and Parameter Extractor, we can see that this problem is an optimization problem with the goal of minimizing the amount of Vitamin K in the vitamin mix while meeting the minimum requirements for Vitamins A and D and staying within the maximum limit for Vitamin E. The constraints include the minimum requirements for Vitamins A and D, the maximum limit for Vitamin E, and the goal of minimizing the amount of Vitamin K.\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, we can use the following variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of cups of drink A used in the mix.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of cups of drink B used in the mix.\n\nThe parameters are as follows:\n- \\( A_{A} = 8 \\): Units of Vitamin A in one cup of drink A.\n- \\( D_{A} = 6 \\): Units of Vitamin D in one cup of drink A.\n- \\( E_{A} = 10 \\): Units of Vitamin E in one cup of drink A.\n- \\( K_{A} = 4 \\): Units of Vitamin K in one cup of drink A.\n- \\( A_{B} = 15 \\): Units of Vitamin A in one cup of drink B.\n- \\( D_{B} = 2 \\): Units of Vitamin D in one cup of drink B.\n- \\( E_{B} = 20 \\): Units of Vitamin E in one cup of drink B.\n- \\( K_{B} = 12 \\): Units of Vitamin K in one cup of drink B.\n- \\( minA = 150 \\): Minimum required units of Vitamin A in the mix.\n- \\( minD = 300 \\): Minimum required units of Vitamin D in the mix.\n- \\( maxE = 400 \\): Maximum allowed units of Vitamin E in the mix.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the amount of Vitamin K in the vitamin mix, which can be represented as:\n\\[ \\text{Minimize } 4x + 12y \\]\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Minimum required units of Vitamin A: \\( 8x + 15y \\geq 150 \\)\n- Minimum required units of Vitamin D: \\( 6x + 2y \\geq 300 \\)\n- Maximum allowed units of Vitamin E: \\( 10x + 20y \\leq 400 \\)\n\nBy solving this optimization problem, we can determine the optimal number of cups of each drink that should be used to minimize the amount of Vitamin K in the vitamin mix while meeting the nutritional requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
