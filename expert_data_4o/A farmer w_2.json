{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, it seems that the problem can be formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) model. Here is the summary of the problem:\n\nVariables:\n- Let x be the amount of Feed A in kilograms\n- Let y be the amount of Feed B in kilograms\n\nConstraints:\n- Protein: 10x + 7y \u2265 30\n- Fat: 8x + 15y \u2265 50\n- Non-negativity: x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize the cost function: 100x + 80y\n\nTo determine the minimum cost of the mixture, you can use the LP model provided by your colleagues and solve it using an LP solver. The solution will give you the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost while meeting the protein and fat requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
