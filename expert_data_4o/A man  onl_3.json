{"comment": "Overall, the code provided by your colleagues is a good starting point for solving the optimization problem. However, there are opportunities to improve the efficiency and scalability of the solution by implementing the suggestions provided in the code review. By using linear programming, avoiding brute force, and treating the cost as a continuous variable, you can optimize the code to find the optimal solution more efficiently. Consider incorporating these suggestions into the code to enhance its performance and adherence to best practices in optimization problem-solving.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
