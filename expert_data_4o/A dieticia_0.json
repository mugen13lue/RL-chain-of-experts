{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as a linear programming problem to minimize the sugar intake while meeting the client's requirements for anti-oxidants and minerals.\n\nLet:\n- x = number of packs of blueberries\n- y = number of packs of strawberries\n\nThe objective function to minimize sugar intake is:\nMinimize: 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n- 3x + y >= 90 (anti-oxidants requirement)\n- 5x + 7y >= 100 (minerals requirement)\n- y >= 3x (at least 3 times as many packs of strawberries as blueberries)\n\nNow, you can use a linear programming solver to find the optimal values for x and y that minimize the sugar intake while meeting the client's requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
