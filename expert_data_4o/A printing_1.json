{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Parameter Extractor, we have the following variables, constraints, and objective for the optimization problem:\n\nVariables:\n- \\( x \\): number of math workbooks to be made\n- \\( y \\): number of English workbooks to be made\n\nConstraints:\n- \\( x \\geq 40 \\): at least 40 math workbooks must be made\n- \\( y \\geq 60 \\): at least 60 English workbooks must be made\n- \\( x \\leq 140 \\): at most 140 math workbooks can be made\n- \\( y \\leq 170 \\): at most 170 English workbooks can be made\n- \\( x + y \\geq 200 \\): at least 200 workbooks of either type must be made\n\nObjective:\nMaximize profit: \\( 15x + 17y \\)\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, we can use linear programming techniques to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that maximize the profit function while satisfying all the constraints. By solving this linear programming problem, we can determine the optimal number of math workbooks and English workbooks that the company should produce to maximize their profit.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
