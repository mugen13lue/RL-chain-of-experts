{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues and the code snippet you shared, here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Variable Naming: It would be beneficial to use more descriptive variable names in the code to improve readability and maintainability. For example, instead of using 'x' and 'y', consider using 'light_sandwiches' and 'heavy_sandwiches'.\n\n2. Input Validation: Add input validation in the function `prob_76` to ensure that the input values for the number of light and heavy grilled cheese sandwiches are valid integers.\n\n3. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to catch any potential errors that may occur during the optimization process using Gurobi.\n\n4. Documentation: Add detailed comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of the function, input parameters, and expected output.\n\n5. Testing: It would be beneficial to include unit tests to verify that the function `prob_76` is working correctly and producing the expected results.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, you can enhance the code quality and ensure that it meets best practices for optimization problems.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
