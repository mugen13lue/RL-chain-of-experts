The objective function is to maximize the amount of hay processed, and the constraints are based on the total acres of land, total fuel available, and total methane gas produced. The function returns the maximum amount of hay processed based on the optimal allocation of acres to the windrower and hay harvester.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
