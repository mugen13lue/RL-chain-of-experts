{"comment": "Based on the comments provided by your colleagues, the problem can be solved by setting up a linear programming model with decision variables x and y representing the number of trips made by the new and old company, respectively. The objective function is to minimize the total amount of diesel used, which is calculated as Z = 30x + 40y.\n\nThe constraints include:\n1. The total number of gifts delivered must be at least 1000: 50x + 70y >= 1000\n2. There can be at most 15 trips made by the new company: x <= 15\n3. At least 40% of all trips must be made by the old company: y >= 0.4(x + y)\n\nThe Python code provided by the Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert uses the linprog function from the scipy.optimize module to solve the linear programming model and find the optimal number of trips each company should make to minimize the total amount of diesel used.\n\nBy running the code with the given problem parameters (50 gifts per trip for the new company, 70 gifts per trip for the old company, 30 liters of diesel per trip for the new company, and 40 liters of diesel per trip for the old company), the function prob_161 returns the total amount of diesel used to achieve the optimization goal.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
