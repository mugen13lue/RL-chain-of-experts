{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves finding the best solution among a set of feasible solutions, in this case, minimizing the total amount of gas used while meeting the mail transportation requirements.\nConstraint:Restrictions or limitations that must be satisfied in order to find a valid solution. In this problem, constraints include the maximum number of submarine trips, the minimum percentage of boat trips, and the minimum number of mail pieces to transport.\nLinear programming:A mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a set of linear relationships. This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to find the optimal solution.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
