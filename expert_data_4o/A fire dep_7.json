{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I would like to point out that the objective function in the `prob_80` function is set to minimize Z = x + y, which represents the total number of firefighters hired. However, based on the problem statement, the objective should be to minimize the total cost of hiring firefighters while meeting the constraints.\n\nTo align the objective function with the problem requirements, you should update the objective function to minimize the total cost instead of minimizing the total number of firefighters. This can be achieved by adjusting the coefficients in the objective function to represent the cost of hiring regular and emergency firefighters.\n\nHere is the updated objective function for the `prob_80` function:\n\n```python\ndef prob_80(regular, emergency_fire):\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        regular: an integer, representing the number of regular fire fighters.\n        emergency_fire: an integer, representing the number of emergency fire fighters.\n    \n    Returns:\n        obj: an integer, representing the minimum total cost of hiring fire fighters.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    c = [300, 100]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize the total cost\n    \n    A = [[-10, -6], [300, 100]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [-300, 7000]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n    \n    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # Bounds for x and y\n    \n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n    \n    return int(res.fun)\n```\n\nBy updating the objective function to minimize the total cost, the `prob_80` function will now provide the minimum total cost of hiring firefighters while meeting the constraints related to total hours and budget. This adjustment will ensure that the optimization problem is solved correctly according to the problem requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
