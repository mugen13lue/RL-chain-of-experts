{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can set up the following equations to solve for the number of servers delivering by cart and by hand:\n\nLet x be the number of servers delivering by cart and y be the number of servers delivering by hand.\n\nTotal customer interactions per hour: 70x + 85y = 4000\nTotal refills per hour: 5x + 20y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1. At least 70% of delivery shifts must be by cart: x >= 0.7(x + y)\n2. There must be at least 3 servers delivering by hand: y >= 3\n\nTo minimize the total number of refills per hour, we need to minimize the expression 5x + 20y.\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations and inequalities to find the optimal number of servers delivering by cart and by hand.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
