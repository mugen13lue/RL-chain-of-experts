We define the objective function to minimize `3L + 4F`, the inequality constraints based on the energy consumption and total number of light fixtures, and the bounds for the variables `L` and `F`. The function returns the total number of light changes based on the optimal values of `LED_fixture` and `fluorescence_lamp`.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
