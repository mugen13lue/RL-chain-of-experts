{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, the problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem with the following components:\n\nVariables:\nLet x be the number of hot air balloon rides and y be the number of gondola lift rides.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Total number of visitors: 4x + 6y \u2265 70\n2. Maximum number of hot air balloon rides: x \u2264 10\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y \u2265 0\n\nObjective:\nMinimize the total pollution produced: 10x + 15y\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, you can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total pollution produced while satisfying all the constraints. By solving this problem, you can determine the optimal combination of hot air balloon rides and gondola lift rides to minimize pollution while transporting at least 70 visitors.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
