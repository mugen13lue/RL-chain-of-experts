{"comment": "Based on the information provided by the Modeling Expert and Parameter Extractor, we can formulate the following LP model for maximizing profit in this scenario:\n\n**Variables:**\n- Let x be the number of mangos sold\n- Let y be the number of guavas sold\n\n**Constraints:**\n1. Budget Constraint: $5x + $3y \u2264 $20000\n2. Minimum Mango Sales: x \u2265 100\n3. Maximum Mango Sales: x \u2264 150\n4. Guava Sales Limit: y \u2264 1/3x\n\n**Objective:**\n- Maximize profit: Maximize $3x + $4y\n\nNow, as a Code Reviewer, you should ensure that the code implementation correctly translates this LP model into a mathematical optimization problem-solving framework. Check for any errors in the code, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement to ensure that the solution is optimal and adheres to best practices. Make sure that the code accurately reflects the variables, constraints, and objective outlined in the LP model.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
