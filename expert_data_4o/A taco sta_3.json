{"comment": "Based on the information provided by your colleagues, we can formulate the optimization problem as follows:\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nLet x1 be the number of regular tacos made and x2 be the number of deluxe tacos made. Both x1 and x2 are greater than or equal to 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\nThe constraints are:\n- x1 \u2264 50 (demand for regular tacos)\n- x2 \u2264 40 (demand for deluxe tacos)\n- x1 + x2 \u2264 70 (total number of tacos that can be made)\n\n**Objective:**\nMaximize profit: Maximize Z = 2.50x1 + 3.55x2\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, you can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of x1 and x2 that maximize the profit while satisfying all the constraints. You can use tools like simplex method or graphical method to solve this problem efficiently. By maximizing the profit function Z = 2.50x1 + 3.55x2, you can determine the ideal quantities of regular and deluxe tacos to produce.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
