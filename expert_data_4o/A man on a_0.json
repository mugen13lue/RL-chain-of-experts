{"comment": "To solve this optimization problem, we can set up the following variables:\n- Let x be the number of bottles of alpha brand drink\n- Let y be the number of bottles of omega brand drink\n\nWe can then set up the following constraints based on the requirements:\n1. Protein constraint: 30x + 20y >= 100 (at least 100 grams of protein)\n2. Calorie constraint: 350x + 300y >= 2000 (at least 2000 calories)\n3. Omega brand constraint: y <= 0.35(x + y) (at most 35% of the drink should be omega brand)\n\nWe want to minimize the sugar intake, so we can set up the objective function:\nObjective function: Minimize 20x + 15y (sugar intake)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using a solver tool or by graphing the constraints and finding the feasible region. The optimal solution will give us the number of bottles of each brand the man should drink to minimize his sugar intake while meeting his protein and calorie requirements.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
