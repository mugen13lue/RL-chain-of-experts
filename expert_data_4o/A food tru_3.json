{"comment": "Here is the Python code that implements the LP model for maximizing profit in this scenario:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\ndef prob_37(mango_cost, guava_cost):\n    c = [-3, -4]  # Coefficients of the objective function to maximize profit: 3x + 4y\n\n    A = [[5, 3], [-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1/3]]  # Coefficients of the inequality constraints\n    b = [20000, -100, 150, 0]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\n\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='highs')\n\n    return -res.fun  # Return the maximum profit\n\n# Test the function with given mango and guava costs\nprint(prob_37(5, 3))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem and maximize the profit. The objective function coefficients, inequality constraints coefficients, and right-hand side values are defined based on the LP model provided by the experts. The function returns the maximum profit that can be achieved.", "expert": "Modeling Knowledge Supplement Expert"}
