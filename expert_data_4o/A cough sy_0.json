{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can set up the following constraints and objective function for this optimization problem:\n\nLet x be the number of kids size bottles and y be the number of adult size bottles.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x <= 50 (at least 50 kids size bottles must be made)\n2. x + 3y <= 250 (total volume of cough syrup available is 25000 ml)\n3. y >= 3x (at least 3 times as many adult size bottles must be made as kids size bottles)\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize z = x + y (total number of bottles)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using a solver tool or by graphing the feasible region and finding the optimal solution.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
