{"comment": "Based on the problem statement and the comments provided by your colleagues, here are some key points to consider in your code review:\n\n1. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total amount of garbage produced by constructing a certain number of wide and narrow trails.\n2. The decision variables are the number of wide trails (x) and the number of narrow trails (y), both of which are non-negative integers.\n3. Constraints include the limitation that at most 3 wide trails can be constructed and the total number of visitors from both types of trails should not exceed 225.\n4. The objective function to minimize is 6x + 3y, representing the total amount of garbage produced by the trails.\n5. The provided code snippet using Gurobi optimization library correctly models the problem by defining decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n6. The code uses the Gurobi library to optimize the objective function and find the optimal solution for the number of wide and narrow trails to minimize garbage production.\n\nIn your code review, ensure that the Gurobi optimization code is correctly implemented and that it provides the expected output for the given test case (prob_285(2, 3)). Verify that the constraints and objective function are accurately represented in the optimization model. Additionally, check for any potential errors or inefficiencies in the code that could impact the optimization process.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
