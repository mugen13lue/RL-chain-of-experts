{"comment": "Optimization:The process of finding the best solution among a set of feasible options to minimize or maximize a certain objective function.\nConstraint:A condition that must be satisfied in order to meet the requirements of the problem. In this case, the constraint is that at least 70% of the vehicles must be limousines.\nLinear Programming:A mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a given mathematical model for a set of linear relationships. In this problem, we can use linear programming to optimize the number of limousines and buses needed to transport party goers while meeting the constraints.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
