{"comment": "Based on the problem statement, we can formulate this as an optimization problem where we want to minimize the total time it takes for the medication to be effective. Let's denote the number of calcium pills as C and the number of vitamin D pills as V.\n\nWe can set up the following constraints based on the requirements:\n1. C + V >= 130 (total number of pills taken over a month)\n2. V >= 40 (at least 40 should be vitamin D pills)\n3. C > V (more calcium pills than vitamin D pills)\n\nThe objective function we want to minimize is:\nTotal time = 5C + 6V\n\nNow, we can solve this optimization problem using linear programming techniques. We can use tools like Python's PuLP library to formulate and solve this problem. \n\nAfter solving the linear programming problem, we will get the optimal values for C and V that minimize the total time it takes for the medication to be effective.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
