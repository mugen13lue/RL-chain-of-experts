{"comment": "As a code reviewer, I would suggest implementing the linear programming model provided by your colleagues in a programming language that supports optimization solvers such as Python with libraries like PuLP or CVXPY. By coding the model, you can easily find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total pollution produced while meeting all the constraints.\n\nAdditionally, I would recommend thoroughly testing the code with different scenarios to ensure its correctness and efficiency. It's important to validate that the code produces the expected results and handles edge cases appropriately.\n\nOverall, by following the linear programming model and implementing it in code, you can effectively solve the optimization problem of minimizing pollution while transporting visitors to the mountain top.", "expert": "Code Reviewer"}
