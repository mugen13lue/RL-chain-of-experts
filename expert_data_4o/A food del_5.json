{"comment": "Optimization problem:This problem involves maximizing a certain objective function (in this case, tips received) subject to constraints (such as available shifts, energy units, and minimum order requirements).\nConstraint:Constraints are conditions that must be satisfied in the problem, such as the minimum number of orders to be delivered, the available shifts, and the energy units required for each type of transportation.\nObjective function:The objective function in this problem is to maximize the tips received by scheduling shifts on bikes and scooters in a way that meets the constraints given.\n", "expert": "Terminology Interpreter"}
